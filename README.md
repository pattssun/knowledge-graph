# Bridging the Gaps in LLM Interpretability of Unstructured Data with Knowledge Graphs

#### Notes on API
- run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in `api` subdirectory
- post request to setcontext took around 6 seconds
- post request to query for answer took around 2.5 seconds
- currently context and kg are stored in backend as global variables, maybe can change to mongodb in the future

#### Notes on Web App
- run `npm install` in `webapp` subdirectory
- run `npm run dev` in `webapp` subdirectory to start app
- **TODO:**
  - visualize kg
  - fix chat style
