Wendell Huang -- Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, Jeff. Happy New Year, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. My presentation will start with the financial highlights for the fourth quarter and a recap of full-year 2020. After that, I will provide the guidance for the first quarter of 2021.
Fourth quarter revenue increased 1.4% sequentially in NT terms or 4.4% in US dollar terms, as we saw strong demand for our 5-nanometer technology driven by 5G smartphone launches and HPC-related applications.
Gross margin increased 0.6 percentage points sequentially to 54%, mainly thanks to cost improvement, partially offset by the margin dilution from 5-nanometer ramp and an unfavorable exchange rate. Our utilization rate in the fourth quarter was at an extremely high-level, partially due to more production output, of which some of the wafers will be shipped in the first quarter.
Total operating expenses slightly decreased by TWD2.6 billion, therefore operating margins increased by 1.4 percentage points sequentially to 43.5%. Overall, our fourth quarter EPS was TWD5.51 and ROE was 31.4%.
Now, let's move on to the revenue by technology. 5-nanometer process technology contributed 20% of wafer revenue in the fourth quarter, while 7-nanometer and 16-nanometer contributed 29% and 13%, respectively. Advanced technologies, which are defined as 16-nanometer and below, accounted for 62% of wafer revenue. On a full-year basis, 5-nanometer revenue contribution came in at 8% of 2020 wafer revenue. 7-nanometer was 33% and 16-nanometer was 17%. Advanced technologies accounted for 58% of total wafer revenue, up from 50% in 2019.
Now, moving on to the revenue contribution by platform. Smartphone increased 13% quarter-over-quarter to account for 51% of our fourth quarter revenue. HPC decreased 14% to account for 31%, IoT decreased 13% to account for 7%, automotive increased 27% to account for 3%, digital consumer electronics increased 29% to account for 4%. On a full-year basis, smartphone, HPC and IoT saw strong growth of 23%, 39%, and 28%, respectively. DCE also increased 2%, while auto decreased 7% in 2020. Overall, smartphone accounted for 48% of our 2020 revenue, HPC accounted for 33% and IoT accounted for 8%.
Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the fourth quarter with cash and marketable securities of TWD791 billion. On the liability side, current liabilities increased by TWD29 billion, mainly to -- due to the increase of TWD57 billion in accounts payable and the increase of TWD38 billion in accrued liabilities and others, offset by the decrease of TWD69 billion in short-term loan.
Long-term interest-bearing debt increased by TWD28 billion, mainly as we raised TWD30.5 billion of corporate bonds during the quarter.
On financial ratios, accounts receivable turnover days decreased 1 day to 39 days. Days of inventory increased 15 days to 73 days, primarily due to the ramp of leading nodes.
Now, let me make a few comments on cash flow and capex. During the fourth quarter, we generated about TWD259 billion in cash from operations, spent TWD89 billion in capex and distributed TWD65 billion for first quarter '20 cash dividend. Short-term loans decreased by TWD67 billion while bonds payable increased by TWD30.5 billion due to the bond issuances. Overall, our cash balance increased TWD56 billion to TWD660 billion at the end of the quarter. In US dollar terms, our fourth quarter capital expenditures totaled $3.2 billion.
Now, let's look at the recap of our performance in 2020. We saw a strong growth in 2020 as our technology leadership position enabled us to capture the industry megatrends of 5G and HPC. Our revenue increased 31.4% in US dollar terms and 25.2% in NT dollar terms to reach TWD1.34 trillion.
Gross margin increased 7.1 percentage points to 53.1%, primarily due to a higher level of capacity utilization and cost improvement. Operating margin increased 7.5 percentage points to 42.3%. Overall, full-year EPS increased 50% to TWD19.97.
On cash flow, we spent TWD507 billion in capex while we generated TWD823 billion in operating cash flow and TWD315 billion in free cash flow. We also paid TWD259 billion in cash dividends in 2020.
I have finished my financial summary. Now, let's turn to our first quarter guidance. Based on the current business outlook, we expect our first quarter revenue to be between $12.7 billion and $13 billion, which represents a 1.3% sequential increase at the midpoint. Based on the exchange rate assumption of $1 to TWD27.95, gross margin is expected to be between 50.5% and 52.5%, operating margin between 39.5% and 41.5%. The sequential decline in first quarter gross margin is mainly due to a slightly lower utilization rate in the first quarter, albeit it is still staying at the high-level, as well as an unfavorable foreign exchange rate.
Now, I would like to talk about the tax rate. We expect our 2020 tax rate to be in the range of 10% to 11%, and this will be equally applied to all four quarters of the year. This concludes my financial presentation.
Now, I would like to start with the key messages for the quarter. I will start by making some comments on our capital budget in 2020 and 2021. Every year, our capex is invested in anticipation of the growth that will follow in the next few years. Our capital investment decisions are based on four disciplines: technology leadership, flexible and responsive manufacturing, retaining customers' trust, and earning the proper return. In 2020, we spent $17.2 billion to capture the strong demand for our advanced technologies and support our customers' capacity needs. In order to meet the increasing demand for our advanced and specialty technologies and further support of customers' capacity needs, our 2021 capital budget is expected to be between $25 billion and $28 billion. Out of the $25 billion to $28 billion capex for 2021, about 80% of the capital budget will be allocated for advanced process technologies, including 3-nanometer, 5-nanometer and 7-nanometer. About 10% will be spent for advanced packaging and mask making and about 10% will be spent for specialty technologies.
Next, let me talk about our capital intensity outlook. As we have said previously, our long-term capital intensity is in the mid-30s percentage range. However, when we enter a period of higher growth, our capex needs to be spent ahead of the revenue growth that will follow, so our capital intensity will be higher. For example, during 2010 to 2014, our capex spending increased threefold as compared to the previous few years and our capital intensity range between 38% to 50%. Because of the increased investment, we were able to capture the growth opportunities and deliver above 15% growth CAGR from 2010 to 2015. Today, as we enter another period of higher growth, we believe a higher level of capacity -- capital intensity is appropriate to capture the future growth opportunities. We now expect a higher growth CAGR in the next few years, driven by the industry megatrends of 5G and HPC-related applications, which C.C. will discuss in more detail.
We also expect this higher level of capital investment to continue to drive our technology leadership, enable flexible and responsive manufacturing and earn customers' trust. While our leading those capital cost continues to increase due to increasing process complexities, it is expected to be compensated by continuing to sell our value, which includes the value of our technology, service, quality and capacity support and diligently working on cost improvement. With this level of capex spending in 2021, we reiterate that TSMC remains committed to a sustainable cash dividend on both an annual and quarterly basis.
Now, let me turn the microphone over to C.C.
C.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Wendell. Hi, everyone. This is C.C. Wei. Good afternoon. We hope everybody is staying safe and healthy during this time.
Now, let me start with our near-term demand and inventory. We concluded our fourth quarter with revenue of TWD361.5 billion or $12.7 billion, which was in line with our guidance, mainly due to strong demand for our 5-nanometer technology, driven by 5G smartphone launches and HPC-related applications. Concluding 2020, the semiconductor industry, excluding memory recourse, was about 10%, while foundry industry increased about 20% year-over-year. TSMC's revenue grew 31.4% year-over-year in US dollar terms.
Moving into first quarter 2021, our business continues to be shrunk, supported by HPC-related demand, recovery in the automotive segment, and a milder smartphone seasonality gained [Phonetic] in recent years.
On the inventory front, our fabless customers' overall inventory was digested throughout the fourth quarter. We now expect it to approach the historical season exiting 2020 better than our forecast three months ago. We observe that the supply chains are changing their approaches to inventory management amid the lingering macro uncertainties. Looking ahead, we expect the supply chain and our customer to prepare a higher level of inventory compared to the historical season level for a longer period of time, given the industry's continued need to ensure supply security.
Next, let me talk about the automotive supply tightness. The automotive market has been soft since 2018. Entering 2020, COVID-19 further impacted the automotive market. The auto supply chain was affected throughout the year and our customers continued to decrease their demand in the third quarter. We only began to see sudden recovery in the fourth quarter. However, the automotive supply chain is long and complex, where many of our technology nodes has been tight throughout 2020 due to strong demand from our other customers. Therefore, in the near-term, as demand from the automotive supply chain is rebounding, the shortage in automotive supply has become more obvious. In TSMC, this is our top priority and we are working closely with our automotive customer to resolve the capacity support issue.
Now, I will talk about our 2021 outlook. For the full-year of 2021, we forecast the overall semiconductor market, excluding memory, to grow about 8%, while foundry industry growth is forecast to be about 10%. For TSMC, we are confident we can outperform the foundry revenue growth and grow by mid-teens percentage in 2021 in US dollar term. Our 2021 business will be supported by strong demand for our industry-leading advanced and specialty technologies, where we see strong interest from all four growth platforms, which are smartphone, HPC, automotive and IoT.
Next, let me talk about TSMC's long-term growth outlook. We are entering a period of higher growth as the multi-year megatrend of 5G and HPC-related applications are expected to fuel strong demand for our advanced technologies in the next several years. We expect global smartphone units to grow 10% year-over-year in 2021. We forecast the penetration rate for 5G smartphone of the total smartphone market to rise from 18% in 2020 to more than 35% in 2021.
We expect the silicon content of a 5G smartphone to continue to increase as compared to a 4G smartphone. We continue to expect faster penetration of 5G smartphone as compared to 4G over the next several years as 5G smartphone benefit from the significant performance and with a latency improvement of 5G network to drive more AI applications and more cloud services. We believe 5G is a multi-year megatrend that will enable a world where digital computation is increasingly ubiquitous, which will fuel the growth of all four of our growth platforms in the next several years.
As we enter the 5G era, a smarter and more intelligent world will require massive increases in computation power and greater need for energy-efficient computing, and therefore, require leading-edge technologies. Thus, HPC is an increasingly important driver of TSMC's long-term growth and the largest contributor in terms of our incremental revenue growth. With our technology leadership, we are well positioned to capture the growth from the favorable industry megatrend. We now expect our long-term revenue growth to be 10% to 15% CAGR from 2020 to 2025 in US dollar terms.
Now, I will talk about the N3 status. N3 will be another full node stride from our N5 with up to 70% logic density gain, up to 15% performance gain and up to 30% power reduction as compared with 5-nanometer. Our N3 technology will use FinFET transistor structure to deliver the best technology maturity, performance and cost for our customers. Our N3 technology development is on track with good progress. We are seeing a much higher level of customer engagement for both HPC and smartphone application at N3 as compared with N5 and N7 at a similar stage. Risk production is scheduled in 2021 and volume production is targeted in second half of 2022. Our 3-nanometer technology will be the most advanced foundry technology in both PPA and transistor technology when it is introduced. Thus, we are confident our 3-nanometer will be another large and long-lasting node for TSMC.
Finally, I will talk about TSMC's 3D fabric. TSMC has developed an industry-leading and comprehensive wafer-level 3DIC technology roadmap to enhance system-level performance. Our differentiated chiplet and heterogeneous integration technologies drive better power efficiency, as smaller form factor benefit for our customer, while shortening their time to market. This technology, including CHIPS stake in solution, such as SoIC, as well as our advanced packaging solutions, such as InFO and CoWoS. We observe chiplets are becoming an industry trend. We are working with several customers on 3D fabric to enable chiplet architecture. SoIC's full volume production is targeted in 2022. SoIC is expected to be first adopted by HPC applications, where bandwidth performance, power efficiency and form factor are aggressively pursued. We expect revenue from our back-end services, which include InFO's advanced packaging and testing to grow at a rate higher than corporate average in the next few years.
This concluding our key message. Thank you for your attention.
Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations
Thank you, C.C. This concludes our prepared statements. Before we start the Q&A session, I would like to remind everybody to please limit your questions to two at a time to allow all the participants an opportunity to ask their questions. Should you raise to -- wish to raise your question in Chinese, I will translate into English before our management answers your question.
[Operator Instructions] Now, let's begin the Q&A session. Operator, please proceed with the first caller on the line.
Questions and Answers:
Operator
Yes. The first one to ask question, Gokul Hariharan from J.P. Morgan.
Gokul Hariharan -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst
Thank you for taking my question. Happy New Year and fantastic results and guidance. So, let me ask a question first on 3-nanometer. Dr. Wei, how should we think about the size of 3-nanometer? What we have seen is, over the last two years, 28-nanometer was a very big node, 7-nanometer came out to be roughly 70% bigger, if you think about peak revenue, compared to 28-nanometer when you had new applications coming in. How -- given the big capex plan that you are also outlining, should we think that 3-nanometer, once it ramps up fully, would be substantially bigger than 7-nanometer in terms of peak revenues? Just wondering, how we should kind of think about the size of this process node.
And could you also talk a little bit about the opportunities within HPC? Right now you are already engaged with multiple HPC customers, but could you talk a little bit about CPU -- x86 CPU, obviously, which is something on everybody's mind. Could you talk a little bit about how do you think it would be exposed to this market as well as we go into the 3-nanometer era?
Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations
Okay. Gokul, sorry, this is Jeff. Let me please summarize your questions -- two questions, we'll take them in the -- one by one. Gokul's first question is with regards to 3-nanometer and about the size of our 3-nanometer. He notes that in the past we have had very big nodes, such as 28-nanometer and then 7-nanometer. So, Gokul wants to know in terms of the peak revenue contribution, do we expect or should N3 be substantially bigger than N7. That's his first question. Correct?
Gokul Hariharan -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst
Yeah. Especially considering the step-up in capex as well. Thank you.
C.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer
Well, Gokul, let me answer your question by saying that we do expect the 3-nanometer will be widely used in HPC-related applications in addition to the smartphones. So, with this kind of engagement with our customer, we do expect our revenue will be bigger, certainly. There's no doubt about it.
So, what is the next question?
Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations
And then, Gokul, I think the second part of your question is looking at what are our opportunities in high-performance computing. Gokul notes that we have multiple customers engaged. But in particular, he is asking about the progress or the status of CPU opportunity and what do we see as the drivers of HPC?
C.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer
Gokul, we don't specifically name one of our HPC's applications, such as CPU to say that what is the growth rate. But let me tell you that, CPU, networking and AI accelerator will be the main growth area in the HPC applications. Did that answer your question?
Gokul Hariharan -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst
Could you be a little bit more specific on x86? I mean, you already had good success in 7-nanometer penetrating the x86 market. Should we say -- should we think that the x86 market share continues to move up a lot as we get into 3-nanometer?
Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations
Okay. So, Gokul, I guess, the -- your question is really on the x86. And looking at 7-nanometer has done well, as we get into 3-nanometer, will our exposure to x86 continue to increase?
C.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer
Again, we don't specifically comment on very specific area. We work with our customer continuously and to supply the very good technology to support their business.
Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations
Okay?
Gokul Hariharan -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst
Thank you. I'll go back into the queue. Thank you.
Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations
All right. Thank you, Gokul. Operator, can we move on to the next person on the line, please?
Operator
Next one to ask question, Randy Abrams, Credit Suisse.
Randy Abrams -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst
Okay. Yes. Thank you. I have -- I got two questions to ask. First on the -- you talked about the automotive and I assume also your mature nodes are very tight. You traditionally haven't added that much capacity on mature nodes and 8-inch. Could you discuss what's in that because you have some mix of that, how you're seeing a strategy to add capacity for those nodes? And could you also look at -- auto has been only about 3% of revenue, should we expect a meaningful pickup in this vertical, both the mature applications and also from new areas like EV and ADAS?
Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations
Okay. Randy, let me summarize your question. You're asking first on the automotive side. He notes our comments that automotive supply is tight. Do we expect a pickup in the automotive vertical? And then, also in looking at the mature nodes, will auto benefit our mature nodes? And then ADAS and other trends in automotive, how do we see?
C.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer
Well, let me say that, now we see the automotive industry need a lot of semiconductor component, and that's including the leading-edge technology for the ADAS system and also some of the mature technology for a lot of applications like sensor, like power management IC. We do see right now a little bit shortage on the automotive, the mature technology supply and we are working with customer to mitigate to show this impact.
Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations
And then Randy is also asking second part on our mature nodes. Given the tightness, will we consider to add capacity for the mature nodes?
C.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer
We always work with our customer to plan [Phonetic] our technologies, capacity, all those kind of thing. For mature node, we used to convert some of the large capacity into specialties. Right now, the trend stays the same.
Randy Abrams -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst
Okay. Great. And my second question, it's two parts. Just want to ask on gross margin and inventory. The gross margins you've improved 4 points year-over-year. Part of that utilization, but depreciation also was up 45% NT dollar to get you 6 points. So, could you discuss if you've had a breakthrough on the cost reduction side? And if -- now, I think last quarter you said about 50%. But given what you've seen on cost reduction and coming off 54%, if you could have better confidence on margin, could continue to do better?
And then I'll just ask a quick on inventory. Was it up 15 days? Historically, you draw down within the fourth quarter, but maybe the trend-wise inventory was rising into early in the year.
Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations
Okay. Randy, let me summarize your questions, two parts. First is on the gross margin. He notes that our gross margin improved throughout the year. And Randy wants to know if there is a breakthrough on the cost side and therefore, the long-term outlook for our gross margin, is it still 50% or not?
Wendell Huang -- Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer
Right. Randy, this is Wendell. You just mentioned that our depreciation increased 45% year-over-year. I think the number should be 15% year-over-year.
Randy Abrams -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst
Okay. I was looking Q4 to Q4, I think that -- just the fourth quarter-over-fourth quarter.
Wendell Huang -- Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer
Right, right. Now, in terms of gross margin in the long-term, we believe 50% gross margin is reasonable and achievable. There are six factors affecting our profitabilities: the ramp of leading-edge technology; price; cost; mix; utilization and foreign exchange rate. Take foreign exchange rate, for example, in 2020, the average dollar against NT rate was TWD29.43. It is now trading between TWD27.90 to TWD28. That is already a 5% appreciation of NT. So, every 1% of appreciation of NT will affect our gross margin by a 40 basis point.
The other thing is the -- in the fourth quarter of last year, as we mentioned, the utilization rate was very high, extremely high, and that's -- the abnormal level of high utilization rate cannot sustain. Therefore, in this quarter, we believe the utilization rate will come down a little bit, albeit is still at a very high level. Now, every point of utilization rate change will impact the gross margin by 40 basis point.
A third example will be the ramp in our leading-edge technologies. We mentioned last time that we expect N5 ramp in 2021 to affect our margins by 2 percentage point to 3 percentage point. And we still think that will be the case. So, if you take all of those into considerations, we believe 50% gross margin is reasonable and achievable in the long-term.
Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations
And then Randy had also asked about our days of inventory.
Wendell Huang -- Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer
Right.
Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations
Increasing in fourth quarter.
Wendell Huang -- Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer
Right. And that's partially because some -- as -- we have a very high utilization in the fourth quarter, but some of the wafers will be shipped in the first quarter as opposed to shipped in the fourth quarter.
Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations
Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Randy. Operator, can we move on to the next caller, please?
Operator
Next one we have Sebastian Hou from CLSA.
Sebastian Hou -- CLSA -- Analyst
Thanks gentlemen for taking my questions. Happy New Year. First question is, I want to follow on the gross margin side. So, you've alluded that in the past two quarters the -- your gross margin, actual result turn out to be either at the high-end or at the surprise to the upside to your original guidance. While revenue is much on the high-end of the guidance, while the Taiwan dollars continue to appreciated second half of last year's. So which means that the margin result to be better than what you originally guided for two quarters consecutively. So, my question is, whether or not the 1Q outlook, the margin is too conservative again? And second, that is whether our structural profitability will need to revise up just as our five-year revenue growth has just been revised up officially? Thank you.
Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations
All right. Sebastian, let me summarize your first question. Your observation that in the past two quarters our gross margin has come in at the high-end or slightly above the high-end of our guidance. Revenue at the high-end and the currency appreciation is there. So, Sebastian is -- question is, first, is the first quarter gross margin guidance too conservative? And what about the outlook for our longer-term structural profitability? Does it need to be revised up?
Wendell Huang -- Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer
Okay. Sebastian, if we compare fourth quarter to first quarter, 54% in the fourth quarter and the mid-term of our guidance for first quarter is 51.5%. The 2.5 percentage point difference, actually mainly come from the utilization, as well as the unfavorable foreign exchange rates. So, at this moment, we are still sticking to this guidance, although obviously, we will work hard to continue to improve the gross margins.
As for the long-term gross margin, as I just reported earlier that we are maintaining the 50% gross margin to be reasonable, achievable based on the elements -- the six factors that I just talked about. Each of those factors will affect our profitability in long-term.
Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations
Okay. Sebastian, do you have a second question?
Sebastian Hou -- CLSA -- Analyst
Yes, I do. Thanks, Jeff. And thanks, Wendell. My second question is on your capex outlook. Apparently that -- at least that's a significant upside surprise to me and I think also to the consensus estimate. So, the last time I think when the Company raised the capex from $10 billion to $12 billion level to the -- like a $15 billion to $17 billion level, then that resulted in a 30% revenue growth in 2020. And then -- so my question is that, I think the capex we invest for the future growth, so whether or not this -- another step-up with the capex to like -- to $25 billion to $30 billion this year's, will represent an acceleration of the growth in 2022 or 2023? Thank you.
Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations
Okay. So Sebastian's question is, looking at our capex guidance for this year, $25 billion to $28 billion, it is above his expectations. So he is looking at the last time, we have an increase in acceleration to capex from $10 billion to $12 billion to $15 billion to $17 billion resulted in us growing 30% this year -- 31% this year. So what is the outlook for our growth in 2022 or the future years?
Wendell Huang -- Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer
Okay. Sebastian, it's too early to talk about -- specifically about 2022. But as C.C. mentioned, in the next five years our target CAGR is between 10% to 15%. So that's already higher than the original target of 5% to 10% CAGR that we used to have before the last conference call. And that's also because of the higher capital investment that we are ready to make to capture the higher growth opportunities underpin that by the multi-year megatrends in the industry.
C.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer
Well, let me add something. This is C.C. Wei. This 10% to 15% CAGR is based on a very high number of 2020. So, we still forecast a 10% to 15% CAGR. That will tell you that how much of capex we need to invest.
Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations
Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Sebastian.
Sebastian Hou -- CLSA -- Analyst
Thank you.
Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations
Operator, can we move on to the next caller, please?
Operator
Next one we have Bruce Lu from Goldman Sachs.
Bruce Lu -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst
Hi. Thank you for taking my question. Great result and great guidance. I think the big difference is, this time is that, you raised the long-term revenue CAGRs from 5% to 10% to 10% to 15%. Can you tell us that in terms of this kind of incremental changes, how much the growth is coming from HPC and what are the other drivers for that?
And in terms of that smartphone growth, I think the 5G penetration is already like 30-something-percent in 2021. Moving forward, how much growth for you is coming from the dollar content growth or the shipment growth, or can you provide more color on the growth?
Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations
Okay, Bruce. So your question is really about our long-term growth outlook, with our growth target CAGR of 10% to 15%. Your question basically is by the different platforms such as HPC, what is the growth contribution and in looking at smartphone, how much is dollar content, how much is unit contribution?
C.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer
Well, let me answer the question by -- actually, the growth rate from the HPC application is higher than the corporate average. And smartphone is very close to the corporate and also automotive is higher than the corporate average. IoT close to that corporate average. Did that answer your question?
Bruce Lu -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst
Yes. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. My next question is -- I want to ask about structural profitability. I understand that all these six factors for the profitability but that's based on the assumption that structural profitability remain unchanged. So, do we consider to move up the structural profitability because of the current supply -- structural growth for the Company or the structural tightness, especially with legacy technology node?
Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations
Okay. Bruce, your second question is on the structural profitability. Given the higher growth outlook, and also the tightness in supply at legacy nodes or legacy technologies. Will we consider to move up the structural profitability target?
Bruce Lu -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst
Yes.
Wendell Huang -- Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer
Bruce, as I just mentioned, we are maintaining the financial objective, i.e., the structural profitability goal of 50% gross margin. And of those six factors, every one of them can affect the profitability. For example -- I'll just use an example in foreign exchange rate, utilization and also the ramp of leading-edge nodes. And, for example, the leading-edge technologies, the complexities increases the capex per K. It's more expensive than before. So we are working very hard with the customer to sell our value, the service value, the technology value and also the capacity value and firm up the wafer pricing. At the same time, we also work very closely with our suppliers to continue to improve our cost, so that altogether we can maintain and earn a proper return in the leading nodes compared to those of the previous few nodes. As a result, we are maintaining our structural profitability goal as 50% of gross margin.
Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations
Okay.
Bruce Lu -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst
So, understand. Let me clarify that, whatever you gain in terms of your cost saving you will still return it to your customer and maintain your 50% profitability target?
Wendell Huang -- Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer
It's -- there are six factors, so all -- you add all of them together, it's...
Bruce Lu -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst
Understand.
Wendell Huang -- Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. Yeah.
Bruce Lu -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst
I understand. Thank you.
Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations
Okay. Thank you, Bruce. Operator, can we move on to the next caller on the line, please? Thank you.

Next one to ask question, Charlie Chan, Morgan Stanley. You're on now.
Charlie Chan -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst
Thanks for taking my question. Happy New Year. So, first question is also about the capex. So in the past for you to spend huge capex on leading-edge is usually for the smartphone application given that the key user is Apple. So, at this time you almost doubled your capex level, does it means that there is a significant upside to the Intel CPU outsourcing? This is the first question. Thanks.
Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations
Okay, Charlie. So your question is on our capex basically. Charlie notes that in the past our large capex on leading-edge historically has been for smartphone platform, this year, of course, our capex number is much higher. So, therefore, he is wondering whether it's intended for a particular customer on the CPU side.
C.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer
Well, Charlie, let me answer the question. In fact, we don't comment on specific customer or specific area. Our capex guidance is based on the current long-term demand profile underpinned by the industry's megatrend.
Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations
Okay, Charlie?
Charlie Chan -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst
Yeah.
Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations
Do you have a second question?
Charlie Chan -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst
Yes, I do. So, just some feedback to C.C. I think we all understand the megatrend of 5G and HPC. So the last question was just to understand whether there is additional kind of growth driver, for example, IDM outsourcing on top of the organic growth. But my next question, I think it should be more related to your strategy because I think your existing customer Intel two days ago, they also commented about, don't rule out the possibility of licensing their foundry process. And actually 20 years ago, back in 2000, I think you also licensed the largest semi process to National Semi. And so, I'm not sure if TSMC, after 20 years, do you still kind of consider this kind of option? Does that mean, the license your foundry process to your IDM customer or even consider some option like a joint venture for this type [Phonetic] operation with your IDM customer? Thanks.
C.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer
Well, again, we don't comment on the specific topics or specific customer. But let me tell you that we are working with our customer continuously and -- to expand the TSMC's business and to support our customers' demand.
Charlie Chan -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst
Okay. Okay. Got you. So, I will get back to the queue. I have some follow-up. Thanks.
Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations
Thanks, Charlie. All right. Operator, let's move on to the next person on the line, please.
Operator
Next to ask question, Brett Simpson from Arete Research.
Brett Simpson -- Arete Research -- Analyst
Yeah. Thanks very much. Questions maybe first for Wendell. So, on the revenue guide, I guess, you're starting the year with a far better than seasonal Q1. But I just wondered, how do you see the year playing out. Should we expect in the second half a typical seasonality this year?
And then, in terms of the capex guide for this year, obviously, there is a big step-up. And spending this year is normally a reflection of how you think about future capacity growth beyond 2021. So, can we assume from the big increase in capex this year that your implied revenue growth in 2022 would be -- will be higher than 2021? Thank you.
Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations
Okay. So, Brett has two questions, one on the revenue guidance. We guided for mid-teens for the full-year -- growth for 2021. So he wants to know how does it play out throughout the year? Is there -- second half, will we see the typical seasonality first half, second half split? That's his first question.
Wendell Huang -- Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. From what we can see, second half is still higher than the first half.
Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations
And then the second part is also capex and growth. Looking at the increase in our capex investment in 2021, noting that we typically spend capex in advance of the growth that will follow. Brett wants to know then should we expect a big year or a large growth year in 2022, sorry?
Wendell Huang -- Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer
Brett, it's -- as I said, it's a bit too early to discuss 2022 in details. But C.C. just mentioned, over the next five years, we're looking at the higher range of CAGR. And also, the capex spend this year means future opportunity in growth, not just for the next year, but also the years after that. So, we are looking at multiple years of growth opportunities.
Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations
Okay?
Brett Simpson -- Arete Research -- Analyst
And maybe just one for C.C. Wei on N3. You mentioned N3 would have the best PPA and we're seeing a lot of transistor innovation at Intel and Samsung in the next couple of years, but you're planning to stick with FinFET at 3-nanometer. And I'm just wondering how you see the transistor density at 3-nanometer. I think at N5 you've talked about 175 million transistors per mill square is the potential of N5. How should we think about N3 in that regard, and relative to some of the transistor innovation we're seeing at Intel and Samsung, are you happy with the FinFET roadmap? Thank you.
Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations
Okay, Brett. So your second question is regards to our N3 and our decision to continue to use FinFET transistor structure at 3-nanometer. You note that at 5-nanometer we can deliver about 175 million transistors per millimeter square. So you want to know how this falls out at N3, or maybe in terms of our 3-nanometer in comparison to Samsung or others, how does it compare?
C.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer
Well, as I said in my statement, that N3 still provide 70% of the logic density gain in addition to all the performance gain, and the power reductions. Whether that's at 5-nanometer you got 175 million transistor per millimeter square, that's a lot depends on what the number in N3. I think that a lot depend on customers design. We continue to say that we offer the FinFET because of the technology maturity, the performance and the cost, are the best combination for TSMC to serve our customer.
Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations
Okay. Thank you, Brett.
Brett Simpson -- Arete Research -- Analyst
Thank you.
Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations
Thanks. Operator, can we move on to the next caller, please?
Operator
Next one we have Roland Shu from Citigroup.
Roland Shu -- Citigroup -- Analyst
Hi. Good afternoon. Congrats on a very good result. My first question is also for the capex spending. And there are two parts of my question. So, based on your sharply increased capex spending, are you considering to sign long-term contracts with customers, especially to those customers who are new to adopt your most leading-edge technology to ensure a proper return of your investment?
And second part of the question is, if this let you have spend ahead in capex EUV because on your -- the lower productivity for EUV when you first ran EUV? So I would like to know how much capex downside you expect after you have improved EUV productivity to the optimized level? Thank you.
Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations
Okay. Roland, we will take your questions one by one. Both of them relate to capex. First one is that, with the higher level of capex that we have in 2021, Roland wants to know that would we consider signing long-term contracts with customers, especially with customers that are new to TSMC, to ensure that we are making a proper return?
C.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer
Roland, sign a contract to guarantee the loading in the future is not our common practice. We always work with our customer and continuously work with customer to serve their demand. And we also put our capex or expanding our capacity according to our current long-term demand forecast, all right? And did that answer your question?
Roland Shu -- Citigroup -- Analyst
Okay. Yeah. Yeah. I think it did.
Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations
Okay, Roland. And then your second question is also related to capex. Roland, let me summarize. I think you're saying that in our capex guidance, your assumption that the lower productivity of EUV means leading to a higher capex level for TSMC. So your question is that, if the productivity -- as the productivity of EUV improves, then will -- how much reduction in capex could we see? Is that your question? Am I summering that correctly?
Roland Shu -- Citigroup -- Analyst
Yes, exactly. Yeah. Exactly. Thanks.
C.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer
Well, let me answer that. We continue to improve the EUV's productivity because we are working closely with suppliers. And so far we -- the improvement is obvious, but it's still not up to our expectation yet. As for the capex will be decreased because of improved productivity, this is in our capex plan already.
Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations
Okay?
Roland Shu -- Citigroup -- Analyst
Okay. So, means for going forward, I mean, even you have higher EUV productivity, the capex spending or capex -- capital intensity probably will be still high this year, or in the near future?
Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations
Okay. So, Roland, his question is that, even with EUV productivity and factoring into our capex that our capital intensity could remain high even into next year.
C.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer
Well, the capex remained high or the capex intensity remained high is because of technology complexity. It's actually that N5 is much more complicated than N7, N3 much more complicated than N5. So, most of that capex intensity coming from this technology advancement. Of course, EUV is a part of it, but it's not the only one reason.
Roland Shu -- Citigroup -- Analyst
Okay. Okay. Then my second question [Speech Overlap]
Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations
Thank you. Roland, I think that's two questions already, sorry, because we still have several people in the queue. I would kindly ask you to get back into the queue, so we can allow everyone a chance. Thank you.
Roland Shu -- Citigroup -- Analyst
Okay. Thank you.
Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations
All right. Operator, let's move on to the next caller on the line, please.
Operator
Yeah. The next one we have Sunny Lin from UBS.
Sunny Lin -- UBS -- Analyst
Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions. My first question is that, I want to follow-up on 3-nanometer. I think -- just want to get a bit of color on your current visibility for the customer adoption into second half of next year. How does it compare with the historical ramp of 5-nanometer and 7-nanometer? And also the cost per transistor for 3-nanometer versus 5? Thank you.
Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations
Okay, Sunny. So your first question is on 3-nanometer, you want to know the visibility into customer adoption of 3-nanometer into second half 2022 and how does it compare to 5-nanometer or prior nodes, and also the cost per transistor at 3-nanometer, is it still declining?
C.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer
Let me answer that. The cost per transistor actually start continue to decrease. But for your question about engagement, we said the customer -- we see a lot of customer, especially from the HPC field, they are engaged with their activity with TSMC.
Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations
Okay? Sunny, do you have a second question?
Sunny Lin -- UBS -- Analyst
Right. So just a very quick follow-up to my first question. Wonder if C.C. would be able to provide any color regarding the ramp for 3-nanometer for second half of next year. Thank you very much.
C.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer
It's early adoption from our customer is both in the smartphone and HPC-related applications. That's all I can say.
Sunny Lin -- UBS -- Analyst
Got it. Thank you. And then my second question is for your 2021 gross margin. So, with capex going up significantly, how should we think about your depreciation growth for this year and also the impact on gross margin? Thank you.
Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations
Okay. So, Sunny's second question is on the 2021 overall gross margin. With a higher level of capex spending, she wants to know what will be the year-on-year increase in depreciation and what's the impact to the overall 2021 gross margin?
Wendell Huang -- Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer
Sunny, the depreciation in 2021 is expected to be between mid- to high-20s higher than 2020. And the impact of -- to gross margins, well, it's too early to talk about the remaining quarters of 2021. But as a general feeling, you look at the capacity utilization that I just mentioned, foreign exchange rate are favorable and also the N5 ramp negative impact on our profitability, those are the factors that may affect our all year 2021 gross margins. But as I said, it's too early to talk about details on the remaining quarters.
Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations
Okay?
Sunny Lin -- UBS -- Analyst
Got it. Thank you very much. Very helpful.
Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations
Sure. Thank you, Sunny. All right. Operator, let's move on to the next caller, please.

Right now we are having Laura Chen from KGI. Go ahead, please.
Laura Chen -- KGI Securities -- Analyst
Hi. Thank you for taking my question and congratulations for the good result and outlook. I also have a question about the capex and the gross margin trend. I think given your strong position in the most advanced technology nodes and extremely high capex in recent years, I believe there must be some strong conviction on the outlook with your major clients. So, can you share with us your view that for the N3 first year contribution will be similar to N5 that we'll have probably more than 10% revenue for the first year mass production? Can we expect that to happen?
And also on the gross margin side, given there might be some swing factor of your major IDM clients for outsourcing opportunity, how would you manage the deterioration rate, which may impact your gross margin substantially? That's my first question. Thanks.
Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations
Okay, Laura, I think that's two questions. But your first question is on the N3, sort of noting our strong position in the advanced nodes, and also the higher capex as an indication of the strong conviction of major clients. Laura wants to know what -- will the revenue contribution of 3-nanometer in its first year be similar to -- or how does it compare to 5-nanometer in the first year?
Wendell Huang -- Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer
Okay. Laura, it's really too early to talk about that at this moment. But as C.C. said, we believe N3 when it's out, it's going to be another large and lasting nodes for TSMC.
Laura Chen -- KGI Securities -- Analyst
Okay. Got it. Thanks. And also on the -- probably the swing factor of the utilization rate that may impact the gross margin potentially on the -- and particularly for advanced node, how should we look at the trend? How will you manage that?
Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations
Okay. So, Laura's second question is looking at our gross margin and then also looking at opportunities, for example, in a particular IDM, if there are swings in utilization, how would we manage that and how would that impact the gross margin? Is that correct, Laura?
Laura Chen -- KGI Securities -- Analyst
Yes. Thank you.
Wendell Huang -- Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer
We don't -- Laura, we don't comment on specific customers or business outlook. The -- what we can say is, we continue to work with our customers closely and to ensure that we provide this proper capacity to them and we also maintain a good utilization out of it.
Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations
And as Wendell --. Yeah.
Wendell Huang -- Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer
Laura, let me add some colors. I think our business has been driven in the past few years by smartphones. Starting from this year on, the HPC also jump on the wagons. And therefore, we looking -- forward looking, we see the traditional seasonality can be moderated with multiple big customer in multiple market segments. So that's our confidence. The other confidence is, our capex includes 3-nanometer, also 5-nanometer. Our 5-nanometer is also very strong, stronger than we expected three months ago. So those two combined to give us the confidence to increase our capex.
Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations
Okay, Laura?
Laura Chen -- KGI Securities -- Analyst
That's very helpful. Yeah. Thank you very much. That's very helpful.
Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations
Great. Thank you, Laura. Operator, can we move on to the next caller, please?

Next one we have Robert Sanders from Deutsche Bank.
Robert Sanders -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst
Yeah, hi. I've just got one question actually. Just could you please comment more on the wafer shortage situation and how severe it is at present? Which nodes are you seeing the shortage most acute? Is it 65, 90-nanometer, 0.11, 0.13, whatever it is? And how far are you essentially booked out at some of these nodes? And do you think there is -- upside to wafer pricing of these nodes? Thank you.
Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations
Okay. So, Robert, your question is on the tightness or shortage in the wafer. He is asking, is it at particular nodes such as 65-nanometer and 90-nanometer, 0.13, how short it is and how long it will last?
C.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer
Robert, most of the shortage actually is in the mature node. It's not in the 3 -- not in the 5 or 7-nanometer per se. But in all the mature node, especially in 0.13 [Phonetic] micron, 40-nanometer, and 55-nanometer, in those areas.
Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations
Okay?
Robert Sanders -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst
Can I just follow-up with -- one follow-up, which is just -- you haven't traditionally built capacity there, but they could become part dependencies for the industry if they are continuing to be short. So, would you actually consider building greenfield to help the industry or you think that other foundries will handle that?
Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations
So, Robert, your follow-up question is then, given the shortage or tightness on some of these mature nodes, will we consider to expand, build new capacity at these mature nodes to alleviate any potential bottleneck risk?
C.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer
Well, actually, we are working with customer closely and moving some of their mature node to more advanced node where we have better capacity to support them. In addition to that, we also try to manage this shortage condition, try to mitigate the impact from this shortage.
Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations
Okay?

Next one we have Rick Hsu from Daiwa Securities.
Rick Hsu -- Daiwa Securities -- Analyst
Yeah. Hi, Happy New Year, guys. This is Rick. My first question is, I guess, you guys mentioned that now your customers are happy living with a higher inventory than the historical pattern because of the macro uncertainties with COVID-19. So, I wonder if your customers would still be happy living with a higher inventory than the normal historical patterns, if the virus -- if COVID-19 is contained. This is my first question.
Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations
Okay. Thank you, Rick. So your question is, our -- the higher level of inventory that we are seeing partly is attributable to COVID-19. What if COVID-19 is no longer -- everyone has vaccine and is no longer an issue, will this continue?
Rick Hsu -- Daiwa Securities -- Analyst
That is correct.
C.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. First, they say that we really hope that the vaccine will work, and -- but even it is working, it takes time and then also our customers still at this -- today, they still have a different approach for the inventory management as we said, because of the secure of the supply is more important than anything else in today's situation. So we don't think it's really to revert back to the historical level of the inventory.
Rick Hsu -- Daiwa Securities -- Analyst
Okay. Thank you. That's helpful. My second question is also regarding your capex because the number this year is really high. So, about 80% of your Tai capex this year is going to be spent for leading-edge. So, I wonder how much of that portion is actually for preparation of the capacity built for 2022 and be -- not for this year. So, can you share your idea with us?
Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations
Okay. So, Rick, your question is on our capex. 80% -- about 80% is for the advanced nodes. He wants to know how much of this spending for the advanced nodes is in preparation for capacity for 2000 -- sorry, 2022.
Wendell Huang -- Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer
Rick, we invest this year actually for future year primarily. So, it's not only for 2022. It may also be for the years following that. So that's -- I think that's something that I would like to share with you.
Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations
Okay?
Rick Hsu -- Daiwa Securities -- Analyst

Andrew Lu -- Sinolink Securities -- Analyst
Good morning. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. Can you hear me?
Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations
Yes. We can hear you.
Andrew Lu -- Sinolink Securities -- Analyst
Okay. My first question is, if your customer has its own design rule nodes with different metal and poly pitch spec from TSMCs one. Can this customer use a in-house manufacturing in TSMC foundry based on the same design or it needs to redesign the chip-based on TSMC 5-nanometer, 3-nanometer design rule?
Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations
Okay. Andrew, let me try to summarize your question. Your question is about our customers' design rules. If the customer has their own design rules, but with different metal and different poly pitch from TSMCs, could this customer use TSMC foundry or use the in-house manufacturing, or do they need to use TSMCs design rules basically?
C.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer
Andrew, we always work closely with our customer to support their design into TSMC's process technologies. So, we can manufacture inside TSMC.
Andrew Lu -- Sinolink Securities -- Analyst
So customer doesn't need to change its own design?
C.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer
Okay. I cannot answer this question because of -- it's two parties cooperation. And as I said, we work closely with them to support their design.
Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations
Okay?
Andrew Lu -- Sinolink Securities -- Analyst
Understood. My second question is, since our 3-nanometer, 4-nanometer nodes work you're ramping out next year. What about second half this year? Will we have something like 5-nanometer plus or revision in 5-nanometer process node for second half this year? Thank you.
Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations
Okay. So, Andrew, second question is looking at second half of this year, noting that next year will have, for example, N3 and N4, then second half of this year, do we have any new node or continuous improvement -- enhancement?
C.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer
Andrew, we always continue to improve the technologies. Last year, we introduced our 5-nanometer to the market. This year, we continue to improve it and next year we will improve further. So we never stop.
Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations
Okay?
Andrew Lu -- Sinolink Securities -- Analyst
So something like a 5-nanometer plus.

Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations
Okay. So, Mehdi wants to know for the first quarter, revenue by technology and revenue by platform.
Wendell Huang -- Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer
Okay. Mehdi, in the first quarter, HPC, automotive, and IoT will increase sequentially, while smartphone will experience a milder seasonal decline compared to its recent seasonalities.
Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations
And we do not provide a breakdown guidance of revenue by technology, Mehdi. Okay? So, do you have a second question?
Mehdi Hosseini -- Susquehanna International Group, LLP -- Analyst
Yes. Just a quick follow-up on capex. Does your $25 billion to $28 billion capex guide include investment for infrastructure in US?
Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations
So, Mehdi's question is, does our capex guidance this year include any investment for the US fab infrastructure?
Wendell Huang -- Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer
Yes, it does. The US fab starts construction this year.
Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations
Okay?
Mehdi Hosseini -- Susquehanna International Group, LLP -- Analyst

Next one, Krish Sankar from Cowen and Company.
Krish Sankar -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst
Yeah. Hi, thanks for taking my question. I also had two on capex. Number one, pretty nice step up in capex this year from last year. Is it fair to assume your investment in EUV is also up this year relative to last year? And then I had a follow-up.
Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations
Okay. So Krish's first question is that, with our increase in capex guidance -- that we guided for in 2021 versus 2020 being an increase, does that also mean an increase in the capex we spend on EUV?
Wendell Huang -- Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer
No, we do not disclose that details.
Krish Sankar -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst
Got it. And then as a follow-up, C.C., you mentioned that how capital intensity is going to be high all the way through 3-nanometer, but you also said long-term capital intensity should be in the mid-30s. So I'm just trying to square that by -- what do you mean by long-term? Because it looks like if the 3-nanometer is still going to be high in the next few years, capital intensity might be higher than mid-30s. So at what point should we expect it to get to mid-30s?
Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations
Okay. So Krish's second question is in terms of capital intensity, with the capital intensity or capex per K at 3-nanometer being higher, and then we have the long-term capital intensity returning to mid-30s. He wants to know when will we return to mid-30s capital intensity level? Is that correct, Krish?
Krish Sankar -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst
Yes. Thank you, Jeff. Yes.
Wendell Huang -- Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. We mean long-term meaning three to five years. I think 2010 to 2014 can be an example. During that period of time, the capital intensity rose from 38% to 50%, maintaining at high-40s for a couple of years and came down afterwards. Something like that should be a reference.
Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations
Okay?
Krish Sankar -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst
Thank you.

Next one, Gokul Hariharan, J.P. Morgan.
Gokul Hariharan -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst
Yeah. Hi. Thanks for taking my follow-up question. One question on capex and depreciation. Do we -- are we having to spend capex a little bit ahead of what we used to spend in past in the EUV era? Is that all -- is that the function of having to spend maybe six to nine months ahead compared to, let's say, in the immersion era? That's one.
And how should we think about depreciation with this jump in capex? Wendell, could you give us a little bit of guidance in terms of how we should think about depreciation for this year and going ahead as well given the heightened level of capex?
Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations
Okay. Gokul, let me summarize. Your first question is in terms of the capex. He wants to know that, are we -- with capex, are we having to spend capex earlier now and is this because of EUV that we need to spend more capex earlier?
C.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer
Well, let me answer the question. The answer is yes, because of there is a long lead time for the EUV tools. The tools are very complicated and the supply chain for the EUV takes long time to prepare for it. And as a result, TSMC also had to plan in advance. That's longer than the normal tools we used to have.
Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations
Okay. And then Gokul, second question is looking at with the higher capex, the depreciation outlook.
Wendell Huang -- Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer
Right. For this year, Gokul, we expect the depreciation to increase by mid-20% to high-20% for 2021 over 2020.
Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations
Okay, Gokul?
Gokul Hariharan -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst
Okay. And maybe just add -- yeah. So even with that, we are comfortable with the 50% structural gross margin?
Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations
So, even with the higher growth in depreciation, Gokul is asking, are we still comfortable with the 50% gross margin?
Wendell Huang -- Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. 50% gross margin as a long-term target we think it's reasonable and achievable.
Gokul Hariharan -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst
Thank you. Thank you.
Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations
Okay? Operator, in the interest of time, I think we'll take the last two callers. So, can we proceed with the next caller on the line?

Okay. The next caller is Randy Abrams, Credit Suisse.
Randy Abrams -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst
Okay. Yeah. Thank you. My first follow-up on US and China, your overseas sites. For the US site, you bought 1,100 acres. Do you have plans to build out a mega fab or potential to build out multi-phase of 20,000 wafers? And then for the China business for Huawei, where it's down to single digits, how is your outlook for the China and also expansion of the China from 20,000?
Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations
Okay. So, Randy, your first question is regards to capacity and fab expansion overseas. So, Randy is asking in the US, in Arizona, we target 20,000. Do we -- will we continue to build it out into a mega fab-type of site? And he also wants to know in China, and I guess, you're referring to Nanjing, do we have plans to further expand the capacity in Nanjing? Is that your question, correct, Randy?
Randy Abrams -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst
Yeah. That's the question, just the outlook to rebound China just post-HiSilicon where it's down to mid-single-digit contribution.

Yeah. This is Mark. Let me take your question. Yeah. We recently acquired a big piece of land in Phoenix, 1,100 acres. Definitely that was the long-term plan to have a mega-scale production sites. But currently our plan is only work on the Phase I production -- I'm talking 2024 with 20,000 wafer per month. And we'll -- going forward we will see, according to the market condition and the cost economics provided by the government support to mend the cost differences to decide the next steps.
On China, yes, we do have plan to continue expand in China. But, of course, the business in China after leading-edge will -- does have a reset, but we do expect the demand in China will continue and we will gradually, accordingly, increase our capacity in Nanjing.
Randy Abrams -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst
Okay. Okay, great. And my second question, if you could give -- I think you gave first quarter, but the full-year growth for each of the platforms? And also for the back-end where you're doubling capex, what's leading that investment between the InFO, CoWoS, SoIC in growth outlook for back-end?
Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations
Okay. So, Randy is asking about 2021 growth -- first growth outlook by platform and then growth outlook by the back-end, and then, between the back-end InFO, CoWoS by segment.
C.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer
Okay. Randy, for 2021 by platform, we think HPC and automotive growth will be higher than the corporate average growth. Smartphone and IoT will be similar to the corporate average growth in US dollar terms.
In terms of our back-end business, we expect it to grow slightly higher than the corporate in 2021. We do not disclose details within the back-end business.
Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations
Okay?
Randy Abrams -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst
Okay. Thank a lot.
Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations
All right. Thanks, Randy.
Randy Abrams -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst
Yeah. Thank you.
Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations
Okay. Operator, can we move on to -- in the interest of time the last caller then?
Operator
Okay. The next one we have Sebastian Hou from CLSA.
Sebastian Hou -- CLSA -- Analyst
Yeah. Thank you. I'm pretty lucky to be the last one and ask again. Thank you. Two follow-up. The first follow-up is, to follow on Mark's comments that -- I think Mark said that the Company has noted its 5-nanometer demand also stronger than you thought three months ago. So, any [Phonetic] value if you can give us more details about which applications are you seeing as stronger-than-expected demand?
C.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer
High-performance computing.
Sebastian Hou -- CLSA -- Analyst
So for high-performance computing is the typical those -- consumer electronics or is more typical HPC or blockchain-related?
C.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer
Sorry, I didn't hear the -- we didn't hear the last part, Sebastian. Your...
Sebastian Hou -- CLSA -- Analyst
Yeah. I'm sorry. I think that the -- for the HPC part, is it more related to your existing customers or more related to the blockchain-related products?
Mark Liu -- Chairman
Oh, let me just add a little bit color on this. High-performance computing as Wendell just said will be the major growth driver of our business. And this field is currently under exciting changes. The high-performance computing's architectures, as you know, from different customers, everybody is striving to get the best performance with different architectures. So many, many -- many more players is getting into this field. So, we see a stronger innovation is coming our way on N3, as well as on N5. Yeah.
Sebastian Hou -- CLSA -- Analyst
Okay. Okay. That's great. Thank you.
Mark Liu -- Chairman
It's not on cryptocurrency, Sebastian. We don't count on that, but we support that. Yeah.
Sebastian Hou -- CLSA -- Analyst
Okay. Yeah. That's fair. And the second follow-up is for -- to Wendell's comment on that. I think this year's -- based on the guidance that we will see the capex intensity to go up to 50%. So, if we calculate -- based on the revenue guidance, if we do some calculations, which means the free cash flow for this year could be -- the growth will likely to be -- will be pretty small or even flat, depends on how things go, but definitely not as strong as past few years. So, my question is that, is the Company still sticking to the dividend policy that 70% of free cash flow?
Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations
Okay. So, Sebastian, your question is then in looking at the capex, looking at our revenue guidance, the capital intensity this year been about -- around 50%, then the free cash flow growth may slow this year. So, what is the outlook for the dividend? Do we still use 70% of free cash flow as the cash dividend formula?
Wendell Huang -- Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer
Right. Sebastian, our dividend policy has two parts, 70% of free cash flow, but not to be lower than the previous periods. So we remain committed to a sustainable and steadily increasing cash dividend. During the periods of higher investment, the focus will be more on sustainable. And as we harvest the growth, the focus will be on steadily increasing.
Sebastian Hou -- CLSA -- Analyst
Okay. So thanks, Wendell. So, given that you're paying the -- investors getting the dividend in this quarter and -- which is that earnings you made like three quarters earlier, so if we do the calculation simulation, which means that in the next 24 months the investor will probably still getting the TWD2.5 per quarter. Is that a fair calculation assumption?
Wendell Huang -- Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer
It's at least, at least.
Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations
Okay?
Sebastian Hou -- CLSA -- Analyst
Okay.
Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations
All right. Thanks, Sebastian.
Sebastian Hou -- CLSA -- Analyst
Yeah, OK. Thank you.
Jeff Su -- Director of Investor Relations
Okay. Thank you, everyone. This concludes our Q&A session. Before we conclude today's conference, please be advised that the replay of the conference will be accessible within four hours from now. The transcript will become available 24 hours from now, both of which will be available through TSMC's website at www.tsmc.com.

2023-Q1,COHR,"Prepared Remarks:
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. And welcome to the Coherent Corp. FY '23 first quarter earnings call. [Operator instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mary Jane Raymond, chief financial officer.
You may begin.
Mary Jane Raymond -- Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, Kevin, and good morning. I'm Mary Jane Raymond, the chief financial officer here at Coherent Corp. Welcome to our earnings call today for the first quarter of fiscal year 2023. This is our first earnings call as Coherent Corp.
And the call is being recorded on Wednesday, November 9, 2022. With me today on the call is Dr. Chuck Mattera, our chair and chief executive officer. After our prepared remarks, both Dr.
Mark Sobey, president of the laser segment; and Dr. Giovanni Barbarossa, our chief strategy officer and the president of the materials segment, will join us during the Q&A to better explain the unique benefits of our strategy, the results we are reporting today, as well as the exciting prospects we have to expand our footprint in our broad markets as we go forward. For today's call, the press release and investor presentation are available in the investor relations section of our website, coherent.com. Our fiscal year '22 ESG report for legacy II-VI is also on the website.
It highlights key points of our board and employee diversity, namely the 46% of our board are women and are persons of color, and that 49% of our workforce are women, as well as our investments to support STEM and educational advancement. The report also details our products that are critical to improvements in global energy efficiency and the increasing sustainability of our locations that produce them. In fiscal year '22, 29% of our legacy II-VI energy consumption came from renewable resources, 100% of our European legacy sites are on renewable energy sources, and we exited this year purchasing approximately 38% of our electricity from renewable sources in our legacy facilities. I think you'll like this report when you get a moment to read it.
Today's results discussion includes certain non-GAAP measures. Non-GAAP financials are not a substitute for nor superior to financials prepared in accordance with GAAP. A detailed reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to our GAAP results is included in today's documents. I remind you that during this call, we'll be making certain forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements regarding macroeconomic trends, expectations for our products and technology, trends in our markets and our expected financial performance, including our guidance.
In addition, we will discuss expectations regarding the recent acquisition of Coherent Inc., including market opportunities and expected synergies. All forward-looking statements are based on current expectations, forecasts, and assumptions, and involve risks and uncertainty that could cause actual results to differ materially from the statements made today. Our comments should be viewed in the context of the risk factors detailed in our most recent Form 10-K filing for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. Coherent assumes no obligation to update the information discussed during this call, except as required by law.
With that, let me turn it over to Dr. Chuck Mattera. Chuck? 
Chuck Mattera -- Chief Executive Officer
Thank you all for joining us today. Nearly 18 months ago, when we were selected as the winner of an intense three-way competition to acquire the company that was long seen as the industry's gold standard of laser technology, we embarked on a new chapter of our bold strategy to diversify and expand our exposure and participation in growth markets that are inflecting due to irreversible mega trends. These include Industry 4.0 in the technology and scale transitions that are underway in mobile and intelligent networks out to the edge; the Internet of Things to support AR and AI services; and also those consistent with our vision of a world transformed through innovations vital to a better life today and the sustainability of future generations, including our silicon carbide and battery materials that enable the electrification of transportation, an important long-term contributor to the reduction of global CO2 emissions. So, with the acquisition of Coherent finally having closed on July 1st, when we enthusiastically got underway, it is from this new base of unique technology endowments, a deep penetration into multiple ecosystems, strong customer intimacy, new business models that include products and service, and the addition of a huge influx of extraordinary and diverse talent to the broad base we had before that we endeavor to deliver sustainable long-term shareholder value.
On September 8, 2022, we transitioned to our new name, Coherent Corp., launched our new brand, and began trading with a new ticker symbol COHR. We adopted the name Coherent because it has the universal meaning of bringing things together. And I believe that a great excitement that stems from some of our really cool stuff will emerge as we bring our extraordinary talent closer together. We hit the ground running together, and we haven't skipped a beat since.
The first 90 days together were super exciting as we follow our well-honed integration game plan that we laid out together for over a year prior to the close. We moved quickly into the first phase of our organizational integrations within the quarter with a focus on the worldwide sales and service organization so we could deepen our understanding of our position and prospects at our largest strategic accounts. Many of these accounts became even larger and have even greater opportunities than either company understood before the acquisition closed. I'll next share some highlights of our performance by our four major markets.
In addition to the numbers Mary Jane will report briefly on the substantial progress we made on the start of the integration activities, I encourage the analysts who participate in the Q&A to direct your questions about the segments to Giovanni for materials and networking and to Mark about lasers. Before we get into the details, though, I'd like to first acknowledge the extraordinary Coherent team that overcame many dynamic challenges and delivered a steady stream of industry-leading and award-winning products and services to our valued customers. We work tirelessly to do what we said we would do. And as always in our company, our commitment is evident in our aspirations, in our actions, and especially in our results.
Turning to Q1. We delivered for the first time over $1 billion in revenue in a single quarter. Regarding the lingering effects of the supply chain, we have seen improvements in lead times for some strategic components and moderation of shortages for others, but we are still affected by pockets of supply chain constraints that have yet to show any signs of moderation. Without these constraints, which totaled $64 million in the quarter, we would have shipped over $1.4 billion, the top end of our guidance.
However, with the strong winds of demand at our backs, we carried on with determination and delivered 1.34 billion in revenue. We grew 69% year over year and 52% sequentially. And consistent with our recent strong growth projections, legacy II-VI's organic revenue grew 20% compared to Q1 FY '22. On a pro forma basis, the company grew 13% over Q1 FY '22.
Turning now to the segments. In Q1 FY '23, the revenue contributions by segment was 44% from networking, 29% from lasers and 27% from materials. As increased market diversification was one of the major elements of our strategy to acquire Coherent, that rationale is perhaps most evident when looking at the size of our communications businesses. In Q1, we derived 44% of our revenue from the communications market, down from the previous 66% in FY '21 and '22 when we were a company only a little more than half the size we are today.
With the increased scale and greater market and product breadth, we believe that we now have a much better balanced and sustainable portfolio to drive us into an exciting future. Regarding our revenues from the other three markets, we derived 34% from industrial, 13% from electronics, and 9% from instrumentation. Our earnings delivery was ahead of plan in large measure due to a relentless focus on solid market share gains, appropriate pricing discipline, driving procurement costs down, and increased productivity. These factors combined enabled us to deliver solid performance with non-GAAP diluted EPS of $1.04 per share.
This was considerably higher than the midpoint of our guidance, and favorable FX contributed only about $0.07 in the quarter. Turning now to the communications markets. We continue to benefit from those customers continuing to make investments in telecom and cable TV infrastructure, and we are gaining share in those markets. Our revenue growth from telecom and datacom were both strong double digits year over year and are both forecasted to show additional gains from that base again in FY '23 compared to FY '22 with telecom forecasted to grow even faster than datacom.
We continue to drive design wins with our industry-leading Coherent transceivers that are increasingly fully integrated into the equipment makers' routers, and we have strong growth projections for our Coherent pluggable products in FY '23 and beyond. Regarding our data center customers, we continue to forecast hyperscale growth in the second half of this year. We are optimistic about the future as we believe these telecom and datacom markets will be long-term resilient as the insatiable demand for products that consume and generate information move to the edge of the network as part of the digital transformation. In anticipation of sustained demand and evolving customer requirements driving our differentiated product road map, we continue to accelerate our investments in our semiconductor laser fabs in the U.S.
and Europe, and our assembly and testing facilities throughout Southeast Asia. As a result of these strong communications drivers, we had record revenues in communications with strong performance in both datacom and telecom, where the split was 57% datacom, 43% telecom. Moreover, we had record revenues from our datacom business as we continue to gain share with the large hyperscalers while enabling them to realize the benefits of their shifts to higher data rate products. In the quarter, 43% of our high-speed transceiver shipments were at speeds of 200G and above, while our shipments of transceivers for 400G ramped up and our 800G deployments accelerated strongly.
Even with the current macroeconomic backdrop, our ethernet transceiver revenue for cloud applications grew at twice the market growth rate. Given our backlog, our current visibility into our customers' projections and our supply contracts that give us confidence in being able to lead the high-speed upgrade cycle, we expect continued strong growth through FY '23. Finally, during the quarter, we received a number of customer and industry accolades. In but one example, we demonstrated our new 200G EML at the European Conference on Optical Communications in September.
The 200G EML will enable next-generation, high-speed transceivers at 1.6 terabits per second. And to the best of our knowledge, we were the first to demonstrate error-free live traffic in public. The excitement for such an enabling product has been tremendous from both our customers and their customers alike. Turning next to industrial.
Our year-over-year revenues for the pro forma company were down just slightly, though we did experience strong growth in some sectors, including semiconductor capital equipment, which was particularly robust, driven by strong demand for our products that underpin EUV and what we believe are strong prospects going forward. In the display market, display capital equipment had another solid quarter with strong and recurring service revenue derived from a substantial fleet of our excimer laser systems deployed worldwide, combined with the highest level of new system shipments in more than a year. Also, we continue to win the vast majority of laser lift-off opportunities and see continued very strong demand for ultrafast lasers for back-end cutting of OLED displays. We remain bullish on the opportunity for larger-sized laser-annealed OLED panels in the IT segment led by laptops and tablets, and believe this aligns with reported new Generation 8 fab investments and will underpin our display business through the next five years.
A recent industry report on the IT OLED panel opportunity forecasts a 5x increase in unit volumes over those next five years, which is also consistent with what we hear from customers. As another example of our enthusiasm about the long-term prospects of the display business, after nearly five years of investment in revolutionary technology, our prospects for laser-based tools for micro-LED manufacturing are beginning to emerge. We now have more than 25 active customer engagements with a constant flow in and out of our applications' laps. Customers are super excited about the results of trials on our 3-in-1 micro-LED demo tools both in Germany and China, and for which we just began installing this week our first tool for revenue at a well-known customer in Asia.
Revenue from our differentiated products for EV battery manufacturing grew 30% sequentially. Market excitement for our portfolio continues to build as we further integrate our comprehensive product lines of both legacy companies to offer more complete and efficient welding product and service solutions. We also broadened our successful cutting head portfolio, including our recently released high-performance 30-kilowatt cutting head and expect this capability to drive a renewal of growth opportunities. Turning to the electronics market.
Our strong performance in Q1 was driven by a surge in demand and record revenue quarter for our sensing business. Multiple factors have contributed to this exceptional result. We were first to market with a new sensor technology platform that enables novel functionalities in consumer electronics products. Second, we grew total share by outperforming our competition in time to market.
As in the past, we expect shipments to this market to moderate in the first half of calendar year 2023, while we continue to develop new products for adjacent markets. Moving to automotive electronics and our silicon carbide business. The electric vehicle industry has been shifting to 800-volt architectures, driven by demand for lower-cost, fast-charging, and compact solutions. Silicon carbide power devices are a must-have for these applications.
Analysts project that demand will outstrip supply for many years ahead, leading to sustained bottlenecks that few suppliers will be able to break. We believe that those who have control of the substrate manufacturing, like Coherent does, will be among those who will be able to grow faster than the market over the cycle. Our substrate customers have long recognized our competitive advantage and are now securing their supply through long-term agreements. So, we are a leader in this industry, and we believe we are building a competitive capability in devices and modules as well and have tremendous growth prospects for this business, too.
Finally, turning to the instrumentation market. Our instrumentation business delivered a solid quarter with revenues at sustained peak levels. Our portfolio of diversified products continue to see very strong demand, including for life science applications as revenue from these products hit a record last quarter. Customers are clearly excited about our combined portfolio, as well as the opportunity to provide additional value and expand even further into the life sciences market at the subsystem level.
Now, I won't take time to come back on after the Q&A, so please allow me to make closing comments before I hand it over to Mary Jane. For over half a century, we remain committed to creating breakthrough solutions to solve our customers' most demanding problems while building an exciting, resilient, sustainable, and valuable growth company. We have the opportunity of a lifetime in front of us. And despite the uncertainty about the future and the dynamic challenges we face every day, we are still aiming to achieve double-digit growth again this year in organic Coherent and the new Coherent, too, as you saw from our revenue guidance for the full year, which includes all of our foregoing comments.
All of our employees are squarely focused on building long-term value for all stakeholders. From that, in a solid financial position, we will continue to do our very best to continue to earn your confidence and trust. With that, let me turn it over to Mary Jane. Mary Jane?
Mary Jane Raymond -- Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, Chuck. The Q1 FY '23 quarterly market and geographic breakdown of our 1.34 billion of revenue can be found on Page 8 of the investor presentation. It is worth pointing out the new geographic breakdown of the company. Q1 FY '23 revenue are now distributed by 53% in Americas, 18% in Europe, 14% in Korea and Japan combined, and 11% in China.
Our Q1 non-GAAP gross margin was 40.3%, and the non-GAAP operating margin was 21.3%. Supply chain costs were $7 million and are not excluded to arrive at non-GAAP results. At the segment level, the non-GAAP operating margins were 19.7% for networking, 27.2% for materials, and 18.3% for lasers. GAAP operating expenses, SG&A plus R&D, were $401 million in Q1.
Excluding $35 million of amortization, $48 million of stock compensation, and $61 million of transaction and integration costs, non-GAAP opex was $256 million or 19% of revenue. Total stock comp is expected to be $35 million per quarter in each of Q2, Q3, and Q4. The Q1 amount is affected by the vesting stock compensation of $18 million for change of control. Synergies were off to a good start in the quarter with $3 million in the quarter and $12 million on an annualized basis due to the retirement of several senior executives and the planned elimination of positions.
Quarterly GAAP EPS was a loss of $0.56, and non-GAAP EPS was $1.04, with after-tax non-GAAP adjustments of $222 million in total. Currency accounted positively for $0.07 in the non-GAAP EPS primarily from the weaker euro and R&D. The diluted share count for the GAAP results was 133 million shares. And for the non-GAAP results, the share count was 149 million shares.
The GAAP and non-GAAP EPS calculations are on Tables 6 and 7 of the press release. Cash flow from operations in the quarter was $80 million, and free cash flow was a loss of $59 million, including capex of $139 million. One-time effects on the cash flow from operations included $60 million in payments for the acquisition, including $35 million in ticking fees, those paid at close, and $25 million in legal and consulting fees incurred by the laser segment pre-close and paid on the closing date. Pretax interest expense was $62 million.
Our outlook of $274 million for the year included the one-month LIBOR reaching 4.2%. It is now forecasted on the yield curve to reach 5.3%. Should that happen on the schedule expected, our goal, along with our debt pays down -- with our debt payments, will be to limit the change in our initial estimate to $5 million to $7 million for a total of $279 million to $281 million. Our net cash at June 30th just prior to the close was $255 million.
Our September 30 balance of cash and cash equivalents was $904 million. Our total debt position is $4.7 billion. We did successfully settle the $345 million of convertible debt in stock as we planned. Using the estimated trailing 12 months on a pro forma basis for the combined company at September 30, the gross leverage was 3.8 times and the net leverage was 3.1 times without the synergy credit.
Using our credit facility definition, which allows synergy credit of $250 million, the net leverage is 2.6 times. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 24%, and we expect the tax rate in fiscal year '23 to be between 22% and 24%, assuming no adoption of new or additional tax rulings. The increase in the tax rate is largely driven by a larger presence in Europe, as well as M&A costs that are not deductible. Turning to our outlook for Q2 fiscal year '23.
Our outlook for revenue for the second fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2022, is expected to be $1.34 billion to $1.4 billion, and earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis to be $0.88 to $1 per share. With respect to our expectations on the full year revenue, we expect revenue to range from $5.25 billion to $5.55 billion. Our non-GAAP EPS estimate assumes that the effects of purchase accounting, which are all still preliminary, are added back to GAAP EPS. Other than depreciation, that is about $5 million in Q2.
The share count is 151 million shares for the entire guidance range. The EPS calculation, including the dividend treatment, is detailed on Table 8 of the press release for the guidance and also shows when the Series B preferred stock is dilutive. All of the foregoing is at today's exchange rate and an estimated tax rate of 23%. For the non-GAAP earnings per share, we add back to the GAAP earnings pre-tax amounts of $183 million to $193 million, consisting of $83 million in amortization; $34 million in stock comp; $20 million to $30 million for transaction, integration, and restructuring; and $46 million for the inventory step-up.
The actual dollar amount of non-GAAP items, the tax rate, the exchange rates, the purchase price accounting, and the share counts are all subject to change. As a reminder, our answers today may contain forecasts from which our actual results may differ due to a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, changes in mix; customer changes; supply chain shortages, both upstream and downstream; competition; changes in regulations; COVID-19 protocols; and global economic conditions. With that, Kevin, you may open the line for questions.
Questions & Answers:
Operator
[Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Your line is open.
Ananda Baruah -- Loop Capital Markets -- Analyst
Hey. Good morning, guys. Thank you for taking the question. Yeah, congrats on a nice start here and on what appears to be really solid execution and focus.
Two quick ones, if I could. You know, Chuck, just to start, what are your thoughts on macro and your thinking as we head into 2023? Does the backlog, which is super substantive right now, does that isolate you? Or I guess, sort of backstop you to an extent? And then, also, what businesses, you know, would you believe could be the most sensitive to macro should companies begin to feel greater pressure in '23? Thanks. And I have a quick follow-up.
Chuck Mattera -- Chief Executive Officer
OK. Thanks, Ananda. Thanks for your question and your comments. Well, we have a strong backlog.
The sales force is busy working to secure an even greater backlog to the extent we can. The macro environment, however it is, is the same for everybody. Our job is to step it up into -- out to what anybody else can do in this market. And as far as the markets go, well, we're diversified.
It's part of our strategy. We'll never get it to a spot where all markets are all firing at the same level. And so, our job is to work to secure as much as we can while we can and to position ourselves for the future. Because even those markets that are maybe only growing a little slower today, we have great prospects for their future as well, and our portfolio is aiming for it.
Ananda Baruah -- Loop Capital Markets -- Analyst
Excellent. And then a follow-up is gross margin was very nicely stronger than at least we had anticipated, and opex dollars were actually nicely lower than we had anticipated. And just so -- and would love context around contributors to the gross margin strength. Do you think it's sustainable? And then, Mary Jane, I guess, the same on the opex dollars.
Did they come in sort of more efficient than you had anticipated? And do you think that's sustainable as well? Thanks, guys.
Mary Jane Raymond -- Chief Financial Officer
So I would say that, first of all, the gross margin, as we talk about every single quarter, is a fight every day. So, not necessarily predictable, but I would say that the company continues to work on that very, very hard. Notwithstanding having $1.34 billion, I'd say, overall, currency probably helped the margin by about $5 million. And I would say, beyond that, we probably had about $8 million help from an expense point of view from currency.
But having said that, we do get rather busy on the synergies early. And the first thing we do to be sure that we can capture all the synergies is to stop hiring. So, that is one thing that paused as we got to know all of our new colleagues on the -- in the laser segment, and they got to know us. And I will tell you that we will continue to fight on that opex for a long, long time.
Because at the end of the day, the company's goal under any circumstances, is to be sure that we are able to invest that money well, particularly on the R&D line.
Ananda Baruah -- Loop Capital Markets -- Analyst
Thanks. Thanks so much, guys.
Chuck Mattera -- Chief Executive Officer

One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Paul Silverstein with Cowen. Your line is open.
Paul Silverstein -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst
Thanks. Mary Jane, given the investment clearly is focused on your leverage relative to macro, any thoughts you can share as to how quickly you expect or hope to deleverage and how you get there in terms of capex plans for the year alongside of the interest expense?
Mary Jane Raymond -- Chief Financial Officer
Sure. Well, obviously, the first thing that we did was the success we had in taking out the convert in stock. So, that took out 345 million of it. You know, historically, what we've said about the pay down of the debt, just let's deal with the pay down for a minute, was that actually we didn't expect that much in the first quarter because the goal in the first quarter was to launch all the synergies first, which sometimes come with cost.
Having said that, given that the Fed has not necessarily led off on what they think they may do this year and what we thought would be ongoing stability in the interest rates in 2024 actually also may change, that has caused us to give new thought to what we would do potentially this year in bringing down the leverage through paydown as well this year. We're not moving away from what we originally said, which was that was in 24 months, we expect it to be at 2.5 times growth. And I think that plus the EBITDA -- the continued work on the EBITDA, I think, will help us from a deleveraging calculation point of view. But the real issue is trying to moderate and stay within our range, if not lower, on our interest expense.
Paul Silverstein -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst
OK. And a quick follow-up, if I may. And my apologies, I heard -- Chuck, I heard your response to the previous question. I heard your comments on the call, and I can see the numbers.
So, it sure doesn't look like there's an issue. But you just had VIAVI last week and Lumentum this week, both referenced some beginning of macro pressure. In VIAVI's case, it was field test units. And what they said was that opex, like, carriers was coming down, and that's always a precursor to capex declines.
And then, you had Lumentum reference some pockets of weakness among web scalers. Again, from your numbers and comments, it doesn't seem to be a problem. But I want to ask you the direct question. Are you seeing any signs of concern from a customer market, product market perspective at a macro level?
Chuck Mattera -- Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Thanks, Paul. Paul, I'm going to ask Giovanni to take it.
Giovanni Barbarossa -- Chief Strategy Officer and President, Compound Semiconductors
Paul, thanks for the question. No, we don't see at all any weakness from that perspective. In fact, we think that we can say at least we have visibility, let's say, until the first half of the calendar year, calendar 2023, very strong demand. And -- but I also want to underline that it is the result of the combination of the strength of the investments of the customers that we have, as well as significant share gains, particularly on the high-speed side of the demand from 200, 400, 800G, where, thanks to the differentiation that we have, we can really take advantage of the need of such type of products.
And so, we continue to gain share versus the competition. So, the two are very strong, and they -- we are not seeing any weakness as maybe others have reported.
Paul Silverstein -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst
I appreciate the response. Thank you.

One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Dave Kang with B. Riley. Your line is open.
Dave Kang -- B. Riley Financial -- Analyst
Thank you. Good morning. My first question is regarding your fiscal 2Q outlook. Just wondering if you can give us a bit more color on your three different segments, how we should think about it.
And my follow-up question is regarding your excimer laser. What's the typical lead times for that product?
Mary Jane Raymond -- Chief Financial Officer
We would expect -- on the first question, we would expect good contributions from all three of the segments.
Chuck Mattera -- Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Dave, for your question. Mark, would you like to comment on the excimer question?
Mark Sobey -- Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer
I didn't hear the excimer question. Could you ask one more time, please?
Dave Kang -- B. Riley Financial -- Analyst
Yeah. Sure. What's the typical lead times?
Mark Sobey -- Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer
Typical lead times for our annealing systems are around six months.
Dave Kang -- B. Riley Financial -- Analyst
Yeah. Excimer, yeah, for annealing -- flat panel and annealing.
Mark Sobey -- Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer

One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Mark Miller with Benchmark. Your line is open.
Mark Miller -- The Benchmark Company -- Analyst
Congratulations on the record sales. You're probably aware of the new U.S. restrictions on equipment shipments into China. I'm just wondering, is there any impact to you on Coherent, especially for [Inaudible] tools that are going into China?
Chuck Mattera -- Chief Executive Officer
OK. Good morning, Mark. Giovanni, would you like to take that?
Giovanni Barbarossa -- Chief Strategy Officer and President, Compound Semiconductors
Hey, Mark. Thanks for the question. Absolutely. First of all, as you probably know, there are no UV equipment sales into China.
So, you know, since that's the vast majority of the market that we address with our parts, we have zero impact from that perspective. Now, if you go on to deep UV and other parts of the semicap equipment world, we have seen less than 5% impact on the short-term demand from our customers. And again, it's mostly because we address the segment of the market for which the restriction has been applied, which is on the high end. And so, the demand continues strong.
And in any case, China wasn't in the loop to begin with. So, we haven't really experienced -- short term, at least, we don't see any weakness.
Mark Miller -- The Benchmark Company -- Analyst
You mentioned moderating 3D shipments after a strong quarter in the first half of fiscal '23. How much of that is due to macro? And also, you know, if you could talk about any of your opportunities outside of the consumer electronics market for 3D sensing.
Giovanni Barbarossa -- Chief Strategy Officer and President, Compound Semiconductors
Yeah. Thanks, Mark. So, first of all, I wanted to make sure it's clear that our numbers were about sensing, which includes 3D sensing. And so, you know, we'll follow the typical seasonal trends and as we said in the prepared remarks.
And we have really not seen any effect from a customer demand standpoint from, let's say, weaknesses in some of the geographical areas that -- where products have been assembled and completed. So, demand has been unaffected for us. So, it's very strong. And, you know, so, we haven't really seen any weakness from that standpoint.
Mark Miller -- The Benchmark Company -- Analyst
So, it's mainly just seasonal effects that you're talking about?
Giovanni Barbarossa -- Chief Strategy Officer and President, Compound Semiconductors
Correct.
Mark Miller -- The Benchmark Company -- Analyst
Thank you.
Chuck Mattera -- Chief Executive Officer

Our next question comes from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Your line is open.
Simon Leopold -- Raymond James -- Analyst
Thanks for taking the question. One on the hyperscale trends that you called out, Chuck, in the prepared remarks, you said you expect hyperscale to grow in the second half of fiscal '23. And I guess, to me, I'm wondering whether or not that implies that you saw any softness from hyperscale in your September quarter or what your expectation is implied for your December forecast, whether you're seeing some inventory absorption or slowing from that group of customers near term. And that's what you were trying to point out was you expect that growth to resume in the first half of calendar '23.
And then, I've got a quick follow-up for Mary Jane.
Chuck Mattera -- Chief Executive Officer
OK. Hey. Good morning, Simon. Thanks.
Simon, what I said was regarding our data center customers, we continue to forecast hyperscale growth in the second half of this year. To answer your question and maybe put a finer point on it, we expect our datacom business to grow sequentially and steadily in the year. Does that help you?
Simon Leopold -- Raymond James -- Analyst
Yeah. I guess what I'm sort of wondering, and I'm not trying to split hairs, but whether or not you saw a little bit of softness. Clearly, your numbers were fine this quarter, the guidance is good, but whether or not that particular group of customers was softer than you expected in your September quarter?
Chuck Mattera -- Chief Executive Officer
It was not. But, Giovanni, do you want to add to that?
Giovanni Barbarossa -- Chief Strategy Officer and President, Compound Semiconductors
So, while some hyperscalers may have redistributed the demand over time and maybe some has shown some weakness or at least decide to slow down, the mix of customers that we have actually is not affected by that at all. So, we don't really see that weakness. And as I said earlier, the fact that we continue to gain share of the high-speed side of the market helps our growth in general, right? So, it's a combination of factors. The mix of customers, none of those that again -- have redistributed the demand over a longer period of time and then the fact that we're getting share.
So, the combination of the two ultimately is pretty good outlook for us.
Simon Leopold -- Raymond James -- Analyst
Great. No, I appreciate that. And then just a quick follow-up for Mary Jane was you called out the $0.07 benefit from foreign exchange rates. And I want to make sure I understand that that's basically internationally located employees being paid in local currency, and therefore, it translates back to a fewer dollars.
And if that's correct, if we assume currency stayed stable in the December quarter, you'll see a similar benefit, and that's what's implied in your December guidance. Is that correct?
Mary Jane Raymond -- Chief Financial Officer
It depends how you -- what you're comparing it to. If you compare it to Q1, it's because it's like Q1, if you compare it to last year, or something else, yes. But we are assuming that the currencies stay in the relative relationship that they have at this time and were prevailing in Q1.
Simon Leopold -- Raymond James -- Analyst
OK. Great. Thanks for taking my questions.
Chuck Mattera -- Chief Executive Officer

Our next question comes from James Ricchiuti with Needham. Your line is open.
Jim Ricchiuti -- Needham and Company -- Analyst
OK. Thank you. So, thanks for the color, by the way, on the export -- U.S. export restrictions.
I wanted to ask a question also about the laser business. If we think about some of the forecasts for the WFE market and the expectations that the market could be down anywhere from -- in excess of 20% next year, in calendar '23, I'm wondering how you're viewing that part of the laser business. Or do you just see more of an offset in the display-related portion of the laser business that's capital equipment?
Chuck Mattera -- Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Jim. Mark?
Mark Sobey -- Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer
Jim, thanks for the question. So, two parts to the answer, perhaps, Jim. Certainly, to quote one of our customers, the impact on China is non-zero. But as Giovanni indicated, it's probably, you know, less than 5% of our semi business; and the laser segment, less than 2% of our overall business in the laser segment.
We're buffered by a large installed base, which really helps. We've thousands of ultraviolet lasers that have -- need to be refurbished every two to three years. Some have been in service for more than 20 years with our customers asking us to commit to support for another 10. And that service revenue underpins our strong baseline business kind of irrespective of just, you know, annual WFE spend.
So, certainly, you know, the outlook for next year is tempered relative to what we've seen this year. But clearly, I think we all believe the long-term trend is very positive.
Jim Ricchiuti -- Needham and Company -- Analyst
And then, if I could, just a follow-up question. I certainly -- I could appreciate, given the diversity of the portfolio, you have some insulation here. But I'm just wondering what you're seeing in -- across the industrial business by geography in terms of China, Europe, North America, and just given in light of the macro concerns that people have expressed.
Mark Sobey -- Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer
That's another good question, Jim. I think we have, you know, a diversity of products and services that we sell into the industrial markets. We certainly have, you know, the benefit of a very strong backlog. We've -- we're -- in some markets, for example, medical device manufacturing, we're No.
1. In other markets, we're maybe No. 2 and 3. We think we've got lots of share upside in industrial.
So, we're beginning to see maybe the first softening in some of the European customer base. But again, we've got the benefit of a very healthy backlog. And again, our diversity of markets in the industrial sector, I think really -- you know, I think gives us confidence that we're looking at a pretty strong outlook for the year.
Jim Ricchiuti -- Needham and Company -- Analyst
Got it. Thanks. Congratulations on a nice start, by the way.

Our next question comes from Samik Chatterjee with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.
Samik Chatterjee -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst
Yup. Thank you. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess for the first one, if I could sort of get some help on understanding the revenue guide for the full year here.
All your comments have indicated that demand is remaining robust, maybe some pockets of weakness here and there, but largely sort of a strong backlog, strong demand. And I'm trying to think about the sort of guidance for revenue to remain sort of flat half over half at the midpoint and particularly any insights on sort of what you're seeing in book-to-bill, etc., to give us some sense of what's driving the revenue guide. Because I believe -- I mean we've been more used to seeing the company ramp through the year in terms of revenue. And I have a follow-up.
Thank you.
Mary Jane Raymond -- Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Samik. Compared to the combined pro forma revenue, I think we will see growth. But at the end of the day, the main thing that we're also trying to keep in mind is the effects of currency on that revenue, right? So, just in the first quarter, we had 16% currency effects on the revenue. So, that's part of it.
If you just multiply that by four, not that that may be exactly how it goes, but it's $60 million or $70 million. But generally speaking, I'd say that when we look at the combined number for the company compared to where the pro forma was, we're expecting to see some decent growth as the year goes on, as Chuck already said.
Samik Chatterjee -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst
OK. So, let me move to the second question. In terms of the operating margins, your networking margins improved significantly sequentially with sort of limited change in the revenue profile, whereas it was interesting with your compound semi margins sort of remained similar sequentially even despite a significant move-up in revenue. So, I'm just wondering if you can help me understand that.
Why not more of a volume leverage sort of in compound semi versus networking, which seem to have a much more material improvement in margins? Thank you.
Mary Jane Raymond -- Chief Financial Officer
So, I would have said -- well, first of all, a couple of things. In the networking business, they had a very, very strong mix in the transceiver business this quarter. They have also continued to work hard on moderating what their supply chain challenges have been, both in terms of physical product and the costs that are involved in that. And more importantly, on their operating efficiency.
I mean it continues to be a goal for us to moderate the cost of operations. I would say probably the other thing that helped them in fairness is that because the RMB was weak. It probably translated there. It's not probably.
It did translate their cost to a lower level. So, there's probably a currency effect on that to some extent, which is a lesser of an extent in materials. Materials generally has around the world, almost all of its sales and dollars in a significant part of their cost in dollars. So, that's one aspect of that.
But second of all, materials also had a very, very good quarter in the fourth quarter as well. And generally speaking, I would say that overall, you know, my original range on materials was that it would be 23 to 25 in terms of its resting margin. So, we're happy to see it at 26 and 27. But I don't know given their mix at this particular time that it actually grows by, you know, say, 100 or 150 basis points every quarter.
And they had significantly less on currency.
Samik Chatterjee -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst

The next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Vivek Arya -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst
Thanks for taking my question. For my first one, I'm curious, what is the implied range of gross margins, Mary Jane, for Q2 and for the fiscal year? And what about Coherent products makes it tougher to, you know, get a tighter gross margin range? Is it just the mix? Is it the variability between products? Is it just, you know, pricing competition? So just any views on gross margins would be very helpful.
Mary Jane Raymond -- Chief Financial Officer
The company doesn't guide on gross margins. But I would say that, you know, as we've said consistently, our goal is to try and keep that margin over 40. And we will continue to do that. And, Vivek, just tell me again, what was your question on the laser's margin?
Vivek Arya -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst
Sorry, just overall gross margins for Q2 and for the full year. So, let's say if the mix you think -- if the mix you're planning for Q2 comes through and the mix you're planning for the full year comes through, what is the range of gross margins that -- so, for example, if we take the midpoint of your full year range, can gross margins, you know, be over 40%?
Mary Jane Raymond -- Chief Financial Officer
Well, the company hasn't changed its range from 38 to 42, just for a whole number of reasons, not to mention the COVID issues that we're still seeing, particularly in Fuzhou. But I would say, if you took the midpoint of that, it would be 40%. But I -- we do not guide on gross margin. So, that's the answer to the first part of the question.
What is the laser question you were asking?
Vivek Arya -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst
No. Not the laser question. I was just saying that what about the company's mix makes it tougher to get a tighter range of gross margins?
Mary Jane Raymond -- Chief Financial Officer
Well, I think at this point, we are still really learning, first of all, the laser products, which nonetheless are very good margins. There's no question about that. And given that the company saw some pretty nice margin improvement just between Q4 on a pro forma basis 2Q, one, together, I think we will continue to work with the laser segment to ensure we understand that and potentially take that margin up. That's the first thing.
The second thing is there was an awful lot of changes in the macro factors with respect to networking that our team worked very, very well through this quarter. But at least, when we think about it, we know that that could still recur. And then, finally, on the material side, the materials team also continuing to see some of the effects of supply chain shortages. And on the industrial part of their business, the first quarter during this quarter is normally their lowest seasonal quarter in the year.
So, over time, I think we will work on tightening or raising that gross margin range. But at the end of the day, the company does not guide on gross margin.
Vivek Arya -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst
And for my follow-up on silicon carbide, how should we think about the contribution to sales and the required capex requirements for this fiscal year? And in general, the strategy around silicon carbide, you know, you have just one large player who is spending billions in capex to stay as a leader on the substrate side. And then you have a number of customers who plan to in-source capacity. So, just kind of a near-term question on the sales and the capex for silicon carbide in fiscal '23. And then the longer term, question on the strategy as to how you differentiate between these two extremes, right, from a competitive perspective in the market.
Thank you.
Mary Jane Raymond -- Chief Financial Officer
Right. So, first of all, we said that with respect to the investments that we're making, we would expect in the sort of '25, '26 period that the company would probably have start to see as a percentage of silicon carbide as a percentage of revenue moving into the 8% or 10% place from where it is today as we continue to make progress on the devices. With respect to the capital investment that we're making, you know, during the entire last 10 years, we've probably doubled the capex -- excuse me, doubled the capacity of silicon carbide every 18 months as opposed to some other competitors who actually had a pause in the middle of that period of time. But nonetheless, we do expect to spend roughly over $1 billion over the next 10 years, the majority of which will be in the first five and the majority of which will be capex.
Having said that, the company continues to look at as it gets larger how it thinks about manufacturing things, including, not speaking about just silicon carbide specifically, but in general, whether or not it could be advantageous to the company's growth, to have partners in certain areas of the manufacturing. And silicon carbide would be an area where we do think about that, but we think about it for everything at this point. As the company gets larger, it may not make sense to have absolutely everything fully vertically integrated. Chuck, what would you like to add?
Chuck Mattera -- Chief Executive Officer
Well, let's ask Vivek. Do you have any follow-up question, Vivek?
Vivek Arya -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst
No, just that one, Chuck. Just the overall strategy as to is there room in the market for Coherent just given, you know, the one really large substrate player and then the desire of many of your customers to in-source that capacity over time. So, what -- where is that window for Coherent to become sustainably profitable in this business?
Chuck Mattera -- Chief Executive Officer
Well, OK. Vivek, let's come back to the capital, too. I would say about a third of our capital this year is going to go into this business. We're going to compete on the basis of the competencies that we have, including the quality, the technology, and the scale that we have and we're putting in place.
We're introducing new platforms on the basis of market opportunities that we clearly have in front of us. And we believe that we can have a strong, profitable, growing, differentiated business just in materials. But in addition to that, we continue to invest and making very, very good progress, both on devices and on modules. The game is going to inflect and unfold here in this decade in the next few years.
And I believe that we're already well positioned, and we're going to continue to establish the front that we need to and the base that we need to, to grow from that. I have very much confidence in our ability to do that, and we're well underway. Let me just make one other comment. This market is going to be so big.
I simply -- you know, we can't see that we'll -- there's not enough capacity in the market today. And there's going to be no one player that can serve this entire market. No one's going to build a whole industry on one player. And we intend to be one of the leaders that not only have already emerged but are sustainably in the pack, OK?

Our next question comes from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Sidney Ho -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst
Thanks for taking my question. My first question is on the -- your semicap exposure. I think, organically, from the old II-VI, the extrusion was only 5%. But I think the Coherent, the legacy Coherent, is more like 45%.
Now, it's all part of this industrial market that you guys disclosed. But if you look at that in totality, we used to think your organic II-VI is mostly tied to UV system produced. But how should we think about the drivers of this segment for the entire company? How much is tied to -- what is the type equipment spending or certain segments of that? And how much is tied to back-end packaging and maybe on the display side?
Chuck Mattera -- Chief Executive Officer
OK. Thanks, Sidney. Sidney, I think what we'll do is -- let's let Mark and Giovanni both give some color on the semicap businesses in their segments.
Mark Sobey -- Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer
Hey, Sidney. Thanks for the question. So, specific to the laser segment, semicap revenue for us accounts for between 15% to 20% of our overall lasers revenue. The areas that we predominantly play in, as you know, are ultraviolet laser-based inspection for reticles and bare wafer and patterned wafer, as well as infrared lasers for junction annealing.
So, those are our main markets specific to the semicap industry. And as I reaffirm, it's between 15% and 20%. I would say it's growing probably at the higher end of that range. But I think an earlier number you quoted was substantially higher.
I'm not completely clear if that was addressed at the laser segment or your prior experience with Coherent, Inc. before. But it's definitely less than 20%.
Chuck Mattera -- Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Mark. Giovanni, would you like to add --
Giovanni Barbarossa -- Chief Strategy Officer and President, Compound Semiconductors
Hey, Sidney. Thanks for the question. As I said earlier, again, we have the benefit of -- on the materials segment to address the high end of the market in terms of the note, if you like. And so, we're really seeing no slowdown.
In fact, if anything, we continue to invest to support the capacity needed to address the demand that we see. So, it's been really exciting for us to address these high-end applications because there are high margins. We are differentiated. We mentioned many times in the past that we have several sort store parts in some of these tools.
And so, we really see, you know, the benefit of years as years of investment having gained this kind of leading position in supplying, you know, our immersion tables, wafer trucks, mirrors, all kind of components that go with these -- for both front-end and back-end tools for the semicap customers.
Sidney Ho -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst
OK. That's helpful. Thanks. My follow-up question and maybe one for Mary Jane, can you help us to think how we should look at quarterly expenses -- operating expenses over the next few quarters, including the impact of all the synergies that you're getting from the deal? Maybe just using the baseline of, I think, $256 million in Q1, how do you think it will end up by the end of the fiscal year? Thank you.
Mary Jane Raymond -- Chief Financial Officer
First of all, I would say that generally speaking, we are likely to see about $65 million achieved on an annualized basis during the first year on synergies. That does not mean that you take 256 and drop it by 65. On an annualized basis, I would say we would probably be able to maintain this year. You know, It may go down slightly from a round of 19.
But given that our target had been 20 to 23, even being at 19, we're down a little bit. Though, as I said, currency helped us a bit. But I would expect that, you know, the goal, for example, in SG&A is to moderate the absolute dollar amount as we go forward from the combined company, moderate any growth. So, that's one element of synergy.
On the engineering side, I do think the company will still strive to look at having its engineering at about the 9% of sales level. From the pro forma company, if we just look at fiscal year '22, it was about 10.4%. So, if that stays at about 9% or 9.5%, you would see that coming down. Whether or not all that's achieved during fiscal year '23, I can't really say.
But generally, the delivery of the synergies across the 250 was expected to be something like 65, 90, and then the balance in the third year. The reason there's more in the third year is because to the extent that we look at, say, two leases in the same area where one comes off the lease is moving things to maybe to a common space, say, one company has a larger site in the same city, that just takes longer. So, those are the types of things that we tend to have, as well as the renegotiation of long-term contracts.
Sidney Ho -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst

Our next question comes from Richard Shannon with Craig-Hallum. Your line is open.
Richard Shannon -- Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- Analyst
Thanks, guys, for taking my question. I think my first one is on the fiscal '23 sales guidance with the ranges there. Chuck, maybe if you can talk about what would lead you to get to either the low end or the high end and, specifically, if you can address any specific dynamics by segment or any timing issues. Or is it just a matter of kind of macro dynamics here as you get to the edge of that guidance?
Chuck Mattera -- Chief Executive Officer
We started that this year in this quarter. We haven't stepped out into this maybe in six or seven years, given this kind of long-range guidance even on the revenue. And we've done it because we have this diversified business, and we have really good visibility, we believe. The biggest single uncertainty that's in -- that we're looking down into is the supply chain.
And, you know, after that, COVID is right behind it in China. And nobody knows how that's going to play out. It's still a long time to go to the fourth quarter. I think it's a very, very solid view that we have today about what we're going to go and aspire to do.
Of course, we need to have orders and order coverage all the way till the end. We're working on that. And the supply chain and COVID, those will be -- is a little bit out of our control. COVID, for sure.
In supply chain, we're doing everything we can to mitigate it. Those would be the two, OK?
Richard Shannon -- Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- Analyst
OK. That's helpful, Chuck. And my follow-on question is just on backlog here. It kind of relates to some of the dynamics you just mentioned here.
But how are you expecting kind of corporatewide lead times to trend over the next couple of quarters? Obviously, lead times pretty much everyone in hardware technology have expanded here. Supply chain is a little bit of an issue. But do you see the lead times coming down? And what, if any, impact do you see that having on backlog?
Chuck Mattera -- Chief Executive Officer
Well, we're not expecting or forecasting a substantial change in the lead times. And we -- our plans are based on what we have in front of us as far as that goes. We're constantly working to improve our own lead times and our overall ability to manage carefully any changes in the inventory for a good part of that. That's the best I can say.
Richard Shannon -- Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- Analyst
OK. Great. Thank you.
Chuck Mattera -- Chief Executive Officer

Our next question comes from Tim Savageaux with Northland Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Tim Savageaux -- Northland Securities -- Analyst
Hey. Thanks for squeezing me in here. And congratulations on the results. On the telecom side, I thought you heard -- I heard you call out some strength or activity in cable TV networking infrastructure early in the call, Chuck, in your prepared comments.
I'd just like to get a little more color on that. And just as a follow-up, you talked about a record quarter in sensing. It seems like that you had a pretty big one a little while ago or a couple of years ago. So, it seems like that may have, you know, as much as doubled sequentially for you.
What is the outlook given the seasonality into the December quarter for 3D sensing? And that's it for me.
Chuck Mattera -- Chief Executive Officer
OK. Thank you, Tim. Tim, I'm going to ask Giovanni to take both. But as it relates to telecom and MSO or cable TV infrastructure, we think about them in the same -- kind of in the same bucket, different from datacom.
So, telecom and cable TV infrastructure are related. And with that in mind, let me just add, we are extremely well-positioned in the largest of these cable TV infrastructure customers that we have. And our business is growing, growing very well. And I expect that will continue to do so throughout this year.
Giovanni, would you like to add to that?
Giovanni Barbarossa -- Chief Strategy Officer and President, Compound Semiconductors
No. This is good. Maybe I'll talk about the sensing outlook. We said that we're going to experience the typical seasonality that we have experienced in the past.
It's just delivered by customer buying and ordering patterns. And so, we just follow that. As we've seen, we had strong growth driven by some new applications and new products that we were able to launch together with our customers. And we expect the typical trend that we've seen in the past to slow down in the second half of the fiscal year and then eventually come back again in the first half of the next fiscal year.
In relative terms, we expect that demand to continue. But these are long-term investments that we have made to enable functionalities that not many companies can enable, many suppliers can enable. So, we feel good about the prospects of this, as I call it, you know, the general sensing market, which does include 3D sensing.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Meta Marshall -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst
Great. Thanks. A couple of just quick questions. Mary Jane, I guess, is it always the policy and integration to kind of stop hiring upfront just as you kind of assess kind of assets in-house? Or is there kind of something different about the environment that may do, you know, want to put in kind of a near-term hiring freeze? And then, on the second piece, you know, you mentioned kind of looking at alternatives on the leverage piece.
Just wondering, is there a minimum cash threshold, or just anything that we should be mindful of as you kind of assess the leverage position?
Mary Jane Raymond -- Chief Financial Officer
First of all, I would just encourage everyone on the phone not to use phrases like hiring freeze. First of all, it is always our policy to get to know our new colleagues first. As the two companies come together, it changes, what some of our global functions are. It changes what some of our leadership positions are.
We do have people in a normal course in either company deciding, you know, that they're reaching their retirement age. That's one of the things you get to know just in the normal course, they're reaching retirement age. And we want to make sure that we have opportunities across the board for people to come into roles especially if they might be larger roles. So, we do that every single time.
Again, no one should be overreacting on anything about a hiring freeze. And frankly, most of my comments are probably more focused on SG&A than they are on R&D as a real important matter. But generally speaking, I think we do spend quite a lot of time in the beginning of our game plan just getting to know both companies. And given the public interaction that was done in the closing of the Coherent -- or the bidding on the Coherent in transaction, I would say both sides, advisors cautioned us to be, perhaps, less engaged, pre-close than we were on previous large acquisitions.
So, there is a long tail here of getting to know each other. And I think both companies want to make sure they're doing things in concert. So, that also naturally allows us a little bit of a pause as we think about expenses overall. You had a second part, Meta, I think.
Meta Marshall -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst
The leverage piece and just, you know, how we should consider either minimum cash or just kind of considerations on that front.
Mary Jane Raymond -- Chief Financial Officer
Well, I think probably it's fair to say that the company probably thinks in terms of just maybe, call it, $500 million of cash to minimum. But generally speaking, we do have the revolver there that is largely undrawn. So, if someone were to -- I don't know, one quarter, it went to 475. I also wouldn't recommend anybody to jump out of window over that.
But generally speaking, I think, we do want to make sure that we can fund the company. We are looking at the capital budget. And while the paydown of the debt is a very, very important priority for this company, the creation of profitable earnings is the most important priority, is the No. 1 priority because that's advantageous to the cash flow as well.
So, therefore, the actual first priority is capex. I don't know, to someone else's question earlier, that we would necessarily dramatically moderate capex unless the market, you know, went in a certain direction, and, you know, we felt that was the prudent investment things to do.

Our next question comes from Tom O'Malley with Barclays. Your line is open.
Tom O'Malley -- Barclays -- Analyst
Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Giovanni, the first one is for you. You're mentioning normal seasonality into the December quarter in the sensing business.
Could you just remind us what normal seasonality is?
Giovanni Barbarossa -- Chief Strategy Officer and President, Compound Semiconductors
Well, normal seasonality means that we'll be higher than the previous quarter, and then it will, you know, come down in the third and fourth fiscal quarter.
Tom O'Malley -- Barclays -- Analyst
OK. And then just on the quarter, on the acquired asset, it looked like Coherent came in a bit higher than expectations. Legacy Coherent came in a bit higher than expectations. I was just curious, did you see any change in order patterns from Chinese customers in the quarter? I know it's a very small percentage of your sales that you're saying are impacted by potential bans.
But did you see any change in ordering patterns there just for this quarter? Thank you.
Mark Sobey -- Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer
So, this is Mark. Tom, thanks for the question. So, China represents a pretty small part of our overall, you know, lasers revenue. And we really didn't see any significant change in order patterns at all.
Mary Jane Raymond -- Chief Financial Officer
And I think we explained to investors on the, say, 6/30 quarter, at times, we got questions that the supply chain was a challenge before Shanghai was shut down or whatever. And I think the team's worked well to kind of get to the revenue that they expected to.
Tom O'Malley -- Barclays -- Analyst

We include non-GAAP measures in our financial discussion and remind you of forward-looking statements risks. All current expectations could change due to various uncertainties.

Dr. Chuck Mattera - Chief Executive Officer
Thank you for joining us today. Nearly 18 months ago, we acquired a leading company in laser technology, Coherent Inc. Since then, we have transitioned to becoming Coherent Corp. and are leveraging our diverse technologies and markets to drive long-term shareholder value.

Our acquisition has allowed us to broaden our market participation and benefit from strong customer relationships. In the past 90 days, integration has been our focus, aligning with our strategic accounts to reinforce our market position.

For Q1 FY '23, our revenue reached a milestone of over $1 billion, with a significant part unfulfilled due to supply constraints. Even with these challenges, growth was evident across all key markets, notably with a 69% year-over-year growth and contributions spread across networking, lasers, and materials.

Specifically, revenue in communications grew owing to robust investment in telecom and datacom infrastructure, outperforming industry growth trajectories especially in high-speed transceiver shipments.

Turning to industrial applications, though slightly down year-over-year, we saw strong demands in semiconductor capital equipment and display technologies. Opportunities in the display sector, particularly with larger OLED panels, align with new fab investments supporting our positive outlook.

The electronics sector benefited from demand in sensing technologies, crucial for consumer electronics functionalities. Our advancements in micro-LED and ongoing customer engagements highlight market enthusiasm for our products.

In the materials segment, significant interest in our EV battery manufacturing solutions underpins our revenue growth, emphasizing the importance of efficient energy solutions.

Lastly, our instrumentation market remains robust with sustained revenue driven by strong demand for life sciences applications.

Mary Jane Raymond – Chief Financial Officer
Q1 achieved a non-GAAP gross margin of 40.3% and an operating margin of 21.3%. The networking segment showed strong performance with notable improvements in operating margins due to favorable mix and supply chain enhancements. However, ongoing supply chain issue adjustments remain integral to our strategy.

As for the outlook, we expect Q2 revenues between $1.34 billion to $1.40 billion, with non-GAAP earnings per share anticipated between $0.88 to $1.00. For the full year, revenues are projected between $5.25 billion to $5.55 billion, reflective of robust demand across our diversified markets and ongoing integration synergies.

In conclusion, Coherent Corp. is positioned for a transformative year with a portfolio robust against dynamic market challenges, driving sustainable growth and innovation.",554,"Operator Ladies gentlemen, welcome Coherent Corp.

2022-Q3,TSM,"Prepared Remarks:
Jeff Su
Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to TSMC's third quarter 2022 earnings conference call. This is Jeff Su, TSMC's director of investor Relations and your host for today. TSMC is hosting our earnings conference call via live audio webcast through the company's website at www.tsmc.com, where you can also download the earnings release materials. If you are joining us through the conference call, your dial-in lines are in listen-only mode.
The format for today's event will be as follows. First, TSMC's vice president and CFO, Mr. Wendell Huang, will summarize our operations in the third quarter 2022, followed by our guidance for the fourth quarter 2022. Afterwards, Mr.
Huang and TSMC's CEO, Dr. C.C. Wei, will jointly provide the company's key messages. Then we will open the line for Q&A.
As usual, I would like to remind everybody that today's discussions may contain forward-looking statements that are subject to significant risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Please refer to the safe harbor notice that appears in our press release. And now I would like to turn the call over to TSMC's CFO, Mr. Wendell Huang, for the summary of operations and the current quarter guidance. 
Wendell Huang -- Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, Jeff. Good afternoon, everyone. And thank you for joining us today. My presentation will start with financial highlights for the third quarter 2022.
After that, I will provide the guidance for the fourth quarter. The third quarter revenue increased 14.8% sequentially in NT dollar, or 11.4% in US dollars, as our third quarter business was supported by strong demand for our industry leading 5-nanometer technology. Third quarter gross margin increased 1.3 percentage points sequentially to 60.4%. Slightly ahead of our guidance, as we enjoyed a more favorable foreign exchange rate and cost improvement efforts.
Total operating expenses accounted for 9.8% of net revenue as compared to 10% in the previous quarter. Operating margin increased 1.5 percentage points sequentially to 50.6%, mainly due to better operating leverage. Overall, our third quarter EPS was TWD 10.83, and ROE was 42.9%. Now, let's move on to revenue by technology.
5-nanometer process technology contributed 28% of wafer revenue in the third quarter, while 7-nanometre accounted for 26%. Advanced technologies, which are defined as 7-nanometer and below accounted for 54% of wafer revenue. Moving on to revenue contribution by platform. Smartphone increased 25% quarter over quarter to account for 41% of our third quarter revenue.
HPC increased 4% to account for 39%, IoT increased 33% to account for 10%. Automotive increased 15%, to account for 5% and DCE decreased 2% to account for 2%. Moving on to the balance sheet, we ended the third quarter with cash and marketable securities of TWD 1.5 trillion. On the liability side, current liabilities decreased by TWD 38 billion, mainly due to the decrease of TWD 116 billion in short term loans, partially offset by the increase of TWD 70 billion in accrual liabilities and others.
Long-term interest bearing debt increased by TWD 88 billion mainly as we raise TWD 60 billion of corporate bonds during the quarter. Our financial ratio, accounts receivable turnover days decreased one day to 36 days. Inventory decrease -- inventory days decreased five days to 90 days, primarily due to higher wafer shipment during the quarter. Now, let me make a few comments on cash flow and capex.
During the third quarter, we generated about TWD 413 billion in cash from operations spent TWD 266 billion in capex, distributed TWD 71 billion in fourth quarter '21 cash dividends and raise TWD 60 billion from corporate bond issuances. Overall, our cash balance increased by TWD 43 billion to TWD 1.3 trillion at the end of the quarter. In US dollar terms, our third quarter capital expenditures total TWD 8.75 billion. I have finished my financial summary, now let's turn to our current quarter guidance.
Based on the current business outlook, we expect our fourth quarter revenue to be between $19.9 billion and $20.7 billion US, which represents 0.4% sequential increase at the midpoint. Based on the exchange rate assumption of $1 to TWD 31.5 gross margin is expected to be between 59.5% and 61.5%, operating margin between 49% and 51%. This concludes my financial presentation. Now, let me turn to our key messages.
I will start by making some comments on our third quarter and fourth quarter profitability. Compared to the second quarter, our third quarter gross margin increased by 130 basis points sequentially to 60.4% mainly due to a more favorable foreign exchange rate and cost improvement efforts, despite continue inflationary cost pressures. Compared to our third quarter guidance, our actual gross margin exceeded the high end of the range provided three months ago, as our guide was based on exchange rate assumption of $1 to TWD 29.7, whereas the actual third quarter exchange rate was $1 to TWD 30.32. This created about 80 basis point difference in our actual third quarter gross margin versus our original guidance.
We have just guided our fourth quarter gross margin to be flattish sequentially to 60.5% at the midpoint, as a more favorable exchange rate assumption will be offset by a lower capacity utilization rates. As a reminder, six factors determined TSMC's profitability, leadership technology development and ramp up, pricing, cost reduction, capacity utilization, technology mix and foreign exchange rate. Looking ahead to 2023, we face challenges from entry ramp dilution, higher year-over-year increase in depreciation cost, rising inflationary cost semiconductor cyclicality and overseas fab expansions. To manage our profitability in 2023, we are working closely with our customers to support their growth and continue to strategically and consistently sell our value.
We are also working diligently on our internal cost improvement. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates of which we have no control over and taking the other five factors into consideration, we believe a long term gross margin of 53% and higher is achievable. Next, let me talk about our 2022 capex. As I have stated before, every year our capex is spent in anticipation of the growth that will follow in future years.
Three months ago, we said our 2022 capex will be closer to the lower end of our TWD 40 to TWD 44 billion range. Now, we are further tightening up this year's capital spending and expect our 2022 capex to be around $36 billion. About half of the change is due to capacity optimization based on the current medium term outlook. And the other half is still to continue to delivery challenges.
Out of the around $36 billion capex for 2022, between 70% to 80% of the capital budget will be allocated for advanced process technologies, about 10% will be spent for advanced packaging and mask making and 10% to 20% will be spent for specialty technologies. Looking ahead, we will continue to manage our business prudently given the near term uncertainties and adjust and tighten up our capital spending where appropriate. That said, our commitment to support customer's growth remains unchanged. And our discipline capex and capacity planning remains based on the long-term structure and market demand profile.
We will continue to work closely with our customers to plan our long-term capacity and invest in leading edge and specialty technologies to support their growth while delivering profitable growth to our shareholders. Now, let me turn the microphone over to C.C.
C.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer
Good afternoon, everyone. First, let me start with TSMC's more resilient near term demand outlook. We concluded our third quarter with revenue of TWD 613.1 billion or $20.2 billion, supported by strong demand for our industry leading 5-nanometer technologies. Moving into fourth quarter 2022, we expect our business to be flattish, as customers are ongoing inventory adjustment is balanced by continue ramp up of our 5-nanometer technologies supported by smartphone and HPC applications.
We expect our full year gross in 2022 to be mid 30% in US dollar terms. On the demand side, we continue to observe softness in consumer end market segment. Other end market segments such as data center and automotive related remain steady for now for TSMC. But we start to see the possibility of adjustment unrolled.
On the inventory side, our customers and the supply chain continue to take action to adjust their inventory. We expect the semiconductor supply chain inventory to pick in third quarter this year and start to reduce in fourth quarter this year. We also expect it will take a few quarters, so first half 2023 to rebalance to a healthier level. While the ongoing inventory correction will also affect TSMC, we expect our business to be less volatile and more resilient than the overall semiconductor industry during this period.
Supported by three key factors that are TSMC's cost raise in the foundry industry. First, our technology leadership and differentiation is much stronger today as compared to previous years. This enable TSMC to win business and enables our customer doing business in high end markets, despite the semiconductor cyclicality. Secondary, through our comprehensive design ecosystem and optimize the process technologies, we are able to address and capture the structure increase in demand for computation and build a strong portfolio in high performance computing.
Third, our strategical relationships with our customers are long term in nature, and we continue to work closely with our customer and technology development, capacity planning and pricing to support their long term demand and growth. As a result, we continue to see strong demand for our leading node except N7 and steady demand for our differentiated specialty technologies and mature node. Looking ahead to 2023 with a successful ramp up of N5 N4P, N4X and the upcoming ramp of N3, we're continue to expand our customer product portfolio and increase our addressable market. There's one other ongoing semiconductor inventory correction will affect the first half 2023 utilization rate.
We expect our business to be supported by stronger demand for our differentiated and leading advanced and specialty technologies, and for 2023 to be a growth year for TSMC. Next, let me talk about the N7 and 6 demand outlook. Due to end market weakness in smartphone and PCs and customer's products scheduled delay starting 4Q this year, our N7, N6 capacity utilization, will not be as high as it has been in the past three years. We expect this to persist for a few quarters through first half 2023 as the semiconductor supply chain inventory takes a few quarters to rebalance to a healthier level, and we have adjusted our N7, N6 capex accordingly.
We believe the N7, N6 demand is more a cyclical issue rather than structural and we expect our N7 N6 demand to pick up in second half 2023. Longer term, we continue to work closely with our customers to develop specialty and differentiated technology and are confident to drive additional wave of structural demand to backfill our N7 N6 capacity over the next several years. The 7-nanometer family will continue to be a large and long-lasting node for TSMC. Now I will talk about our N3 and N3E status.
Our N3 is on track for volume production later this quarter with good year. We expect a smooth ramp in 2023, driven by both HPC and smartphone applications. Our customers' demand for N3 exceeds our ability to supply partially due to the ongoing tool delivery issues, and we expect entry to be fully utilized in 2023. We expect N3 revenue in 2023 to be higher than N5 revenue in its first year in 2020 and for N3E to contribute mid-single-digit percentage of our wafer revenue in 2023, as our overall revenue base is much larger today than in 2020.
N3E will further extend our N3 family with the enhanced performance power and yield, and offer complete platform support for both smartphone and HPC applications. N3E development is progressing ahead of plan, and volume production is now scheduled for second half 2023. Despite the ongoing inventory correction, we observe a high level of customer engagement at both N3 and N3E with a number of tape-outs more than two times than that of N5 in its first and second year. Thus, we are working closely with our tool supplier to address toward delivery challenges and prepare more 3-nanometer capacity to support our customers with strong demand in 2023, 2024 and beyond.
Our 3-nanometer technology will be the most advanced semiconductor technology in both PPA and transistor technology when it is introduced. We are confident that N3 family will be another large and long-lasting node for TSMC. Finally, let me talk about the future driver of leading node adoption. TSMC's ambition is to be the trusted technology and capacity provider for the global logic IC industry for years to come.
Our job is to help our customers unleash their innovations and enable them to capture greater value and win in their end markets. As the industry continues to pursue scaling, it is true that damage shrink is slowing down and becoming more challenging for everyone due to rising process complexity. However, it is also true that demand for energy-efficient computing is accelerating in an intelligent and connected world as technology is becoming more pervasive and essential in people's lives. The semiconductor industry value in the supply chain is increasing, and the value of technology platform is expanding beyond the scope of geometry shrink alone and increasingly toward greater power efficiency.
As a result, our customers value much more than simply transistor cost. System performance and power efficiency has become key motivation for customers who adopt our leading node technologies. By working closely with our customer and technology development, our N3 and N2 will deliver full node stride in performance and power benefits while offering the industry's most advanced transistor scaling. We expect strong demand for our leading node technologies, driven by both smartphone and HPC applications to fuel our long-term revenue growth of 15% to 20% CAGR over the next several years in U.S.
dollar terms. With our leadership in both leading-edge process technology and 3D solutions, TSMC's technology cadence remain constant to deliver the value of our technology platform. We will continue to extend our overall competitiveness and technology leadership while delivering a predictable technology cadence that help our customers to enhance their product competitiveness and grow their market well into the future. This concluding our key message, and thank you for your attention.
Jeff Su
Thank you, C.C. This concludes our prepared statements. Before we begin the Q&A session, I would like to remind everybody to please limit your questions to two at a time to allow all the participants an opportunity to ask questions. Should you wish to raise your question in Chinese, I will translate it to English before our Management answers your question.
[Operator instructions] Now let's begin the Q&A session, operator can we please proceed with the first participant on the line.
Questions & Answers:
Operator
Yes, Jeff. The first one to ask questions Gokul Hariharan from J.P. Morgan. Go ahead, please.
Gokul Hariharan -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst
Yes, good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the great results, especially on the margins. So the first question is on N7 and N6, this utilization slack that we are observing. Could we give a little bit more detail on why that is happening and why we think this is short-lived, a couple of quarters issue and we get a pick back in the utilization in the second half of the year? And I think last time we saw, this was for 28-nanometer, but that lasted for a much longer period of time.
So could you also give us some kind of comparison with what happened back in 28-nanometer and why this is going to be very different? And maybe a little bit more color on what are the areas of backfill demand for N7 and N6 as the high-end smartphone processors and HPC start to move on to N5 and then N3. That's my first question.
Jeff Su
OK, Gokul, let me please allow me to summarize your first question. So Gokul's first question is on N7 and N6. He wants to understand what is driving the utilization slack. Why do we believe it is short-lived and that the demand for N7 and N6 can pick up in the second half? And then also on the little bit longer-term outlook, why we believe that N7 can be backfilled, and it will not be like N28 a few years ago with a few years of underutilization.
C.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer
Well, Gokul, maybe answer your question first on the why demand dropped. Demand dropped because of market becomes soft. As we said, in the weakness in the smartphone and PCs. And also a big factor is our customers' product schedule delay.
And all in all, put all together, so we think that our utilization has been affected in fourth quarter this year and all the way to the first half of 2023. For the longer term, we continue to work closely with our customers. And actually, let me also say that this is a cyclical issue. So it will pick up anyway.
And we believe we will pick up in the second half of 2023. And for the longer term, we continue to work closely with our customers to develop specialty and differentiated technology to drive additional wave of structural demand from consumer, RF, connectivity, etc., and other application to backfill our N7, N6 capacity and so for the next several years. That's all I --
Jeff Su
Does that answer your first question, Gokul?
Gokul Hariharan -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst
Yes. My second question would be on the capex outlook. Now that we bring down the capex slightly for 2022, could you talk a little bit about what is the outlook direction for 2023 at least, if not absolute numbers, but just direction? Are we going to be flattish or it's likely to be going down? Second is, also, could you also give us an update on the schedule for the new fabs, Cauchon, Kumamoto, Nanjing, and Arizona? Is there any change in the schedules in terms of these fabs coming into production? Thank you.
Jeff Su
OK, thank you, Gokul. So Gokul's second question is on capex and capacity. So first, he wants to hear, of course, he says that we have tightened up our capex in 2022. So he is asking for 2023 directionally, is there an indication of 2023 capex? And then he would also like an update on our expansion plans in Guosheng, Nanjing, Arizona, and Kumamoto.
Wendell Huang -- Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
OK, Gokul, let me answer you the first part. For 2023 capex, it is too early to comment. We will provide you with a specific guidance in January. However, as we said, we have tightened up our 2022 capex to reflect the current medium outlook, as well as two delivery issues.
Looking ahead to 2023, we will continue to be careful and manage our business prudently given the near-term uncertainties. We will adjust and tighten up our capital spending where appropriate, but we will continue to work closely with our customers to invest for the long-term structural market demand profile to support their growth.
C.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer
Well, let me answer the second part of Gokul's question. Gokul, you asked about the progress of our Arizona fab, Nanjing fab, and the Gaozong. And let me say that Arizona fab work will continue and on schedule. There's no doubt about it because this is a N5 family which still have a very strong demand.
And for Nanjing we just get our one-year authorization for 28-nanometer expansion. So it is on schedule also. For Gaozong, initially, we planned two fab at the beginning of 28-nanometer expansion and the N7. Now N7 has been adjusted.
And so but 28-nanometer expansion is continued and on schedule.
Jeff Su
And also Kumamoto.
C.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer
OK. Also the Japan fab is on schedule to meet the customer's demand.
Gokul Hariharan -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst
Got it. Thank you very much.
Jeff Su
All right, thank you, Gokul. Operator, can we move on to the next participant, please.
Operator
The next one to ask questions is Bruce from Goldman Sachs. Go ahead, please.
Bruce Lu -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst
Thank you for taking my questions. So my first question is regarding to the HPC, which is a key growth driver for TSMC for the coming years. However, with the reason U.S. new restriction to China, what do you think about the HPC demand moving forward.
What kind of impact is going to see a slowdown from China? Or are you going to see the collaboration from the non-China side?
Jeff Su
OK, so Bruce's first question is on HPC. He notes HPC, we have said repeatedly, will be TSMC's key growth driver and main engine in the next few years. He wants to know, I believe, Bruce, the impact of the recent U.S. regulations, does that affect the overall HPC demand or the overall profile.
Is that correct?
Bruce Lu -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst
Yes, what's the impact from this new restriction to TSMC and overall industry?
C.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer
OK, let me answer that. Bruce, it's based on our initial reading and feedback from our customers. The new regulation set the control was called at very high-end specification, which is primarily used for AI or supercomputing applications. Therefore, our initial assessment is the impact to TSMC is limited and manageable.
We will continue to closely monitor the situation to ensure that we are all in full compliance with all the rules and regulation. And for the longer term, it's too early to really assess all the true impact or influence, but we will give you the update in the following earnings call.
Bruce Lu -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst
OK, understand that. Thank you. So my next question is regarding to the cyclical nature for the 7-nanometer. But we also noticed that most of your other nodes, the capacity utilization rate is still at a very, very high level or at least much better than 7-nanometers as management mentioned.
Why is 7-nanometer so cyclical? Because maybe because you guys are too big, you have to industry or what is the difference between your 7-nanometers and your other nodes?
Jeff Su
OK, so Bruce's second question is looking at N7 specifically. He wants to know our other nodes seem -- the utilization still seems to be holding up well. So why specifically N7 is more cyclical and utilization is not as high as it has been. Is that correct, Bruce?
Bruce Lu -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst
Yes.
C.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer
OK. It just happened that most of my smartphone and PCs customer are using N7 and N6 node. And it just happened, the market weakness in the smartphone and PC happening at the same time. And also other customers or product schedule delay, all in all, that's why it becomes lower utilization rate as compared with other node.
If you want to compare with the N5 or compare with the 28-nanometer, our orders are very -- is still at a very high demand, and we will continue to enjoy the higher market share.
Bruce Lu -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst
I want to dig in a bit because we get used to like TSMC will manage your customers' product and overall outlook even with some tape-out you can make it out with someone else. But anything different with this time that 7-nanometer, you cannot have as good as your other nodes?
Jeff Su
So Bruce wants to still understand why the 7-nanometer utilization cannot be as high as the other nodes if we work closely with customers, and is well planned.
C.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer
Well, again, Bruce, we work closely with our customers, but our customers get caught in this inventory correction and the market downturn. They didn't know this one, probably two quarters before. And at the beginning of this year, they will still give us a very high number of their forecast. And it just happened, it just happened.
But as we said, we believe this is a cyclical issue. And it will pick up. But before that, it probably will take a few quarters.
Bruce Lu -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst
I see, understand. Thank you. We just get too used to it to be like -- to expect TSMC always deliver a much better result.
C.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer
I understand.
Jeff Su
OK. Thank you, Bruce. Operator, can we move on to the next caller please.
Operator
Next, we have Randy Abrams from Credit Suisse.
Randy Abrams -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst
Yes, OK. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask a two-part first question. You mentioned in the prepared remarks about HPC and auto continue to be stable, but seem to signal it may change.
If you could give your view how you see inventory levels and some of the forward demand outlook from those areas. And the second part, I just want to see if we could get a bit better visibility on first half first quarter, how do you see it versus normal seasonal? And then for the trough, do you expect first quarter could be the bottom, or do you see the trend that we could be toward the second quarter?
Jeff Su
OK, so Randy's question is really looking at again from the end demand segment. Data center and automotive, we say are remaining steady at TSMC for now. He wants to understand though, what is the outlook down the road, and what does that mean for inventory levels? And then secondly is also he wants to see if we can provide some more granularity about first quarter outlook versus seasonality and whether we think the first quarter can be the bottom for the industry. Is that correct, Randy?
Randy Abrams -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst
Yes, that's correct.
C.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer
OK, let me answer this one. Of course, we say that so far, our customers give us their demand forecast -- so the data center and automotive related are still steady. But now the market becomes solved and will take a more conservative way in our planning for 2023. And that's why we say that we don't rule out the possibility.
They might have some correction also, but we did not see it right now, to be frank with you. And for the inventory correction in 2023, all we want to say is like that. We expect probably 2023, the semiconductor industry were likely to decline. But TSMC also is not immune, we believe our technology position, strong portfolio in HPC and longer-term strategic relationship with customers will enable our business to be more resilient than the overall semiconductor industry.
And that's why we say in 2023 still a growth year for TSMC and the overall industry probably will decline.
Randy Abrams -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst
OK. Again, and I'll ask a quick follow-up, and then the second question. I guess just a sense because it's still very firm in fourth quarter, if you're seeing a pretty meaningful falloff into first quarter, like some years 10%. 2019 declined over 20%.
So just trying to get a rough feel of the type of decline factoring you're gaining some content and share. That's fell to the first. And then the second question, actually, just on gross margin because of a lot of headwinds, I think, Wendell, you talked about. If you could give -- just on a couple of these depreciation factoring the recent capex, how much up and whether it's also front end or more back half loaded given the 3-nanometer ramp.
And then for the start-up costs for N3 if you expect similar to N5, given smaller percent of revenue, how much dilution from N3? Thank you.
Jeff Su
OK, Randy. So let me summarize. So, Randy, quick, I think we will not comment on the first quarter, but I think we can make some comment just sort of in terms of the overall inventory picture in looking into next year.
C.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer
Well, actually, if you ask my opinion on the inventory picture and the inventory correction, it's too early to provide a specific number. However, the inventory correction were likely see its biggest impact sometimes in the first half 2023.
Jeff Su
OK, and then the second part related to the gross margin, maybe Wendell can address what is the outlook for depreciation next year, some of the -- and then is it front or back-end loaded? And also what type of dilution we expect from 3-nanometer as it ramps in 2023.
Wendell Huang -- Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
OK, Randy. For full year depreciation for next year, it's too early to talk about that. But this year is mid-single-digit increase year on year. But next year, we expect it will likely to be meaningfully higher.
We will give you the guidance in January. As to the dilution from N3, it will be between two to three percentage points on a whole year basis on our gross margins.
Randy Abrams -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst
OK, and actually, one follow-up. Do you think on a single quarter with the inventory correction, do you expect to keep the 53 and above factoring were coming from a very high level even through that first half inventory correction?
Jeff Su
Right. It is too early to talk about 2023, gross margin including quarter over quarter. But even with all these cost challenges, we believe our structural profitability can be maintained, and we are confident to deliver a long-term gross margin of 53% and higher. OK.
Randy Abrams -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst
OK, great, thanks.
Jeff Su
Thank you, Randy. Operator can we move on to the next participant, please.
Operator
Next one to ask questions, Charlie Chan from Morgan Stanley.
Charlie Chan -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst
Good afternoon, and thanks for taking my questions. So my first question to management is about whether the company consider a share buyback because the company seems to suggest recent inventory correction is just a cyclical, you're still very positive on the long term. And I think the share price really revealed comes long-term value, right, also shareholders' value. So I'm not sure if a company wants to do share buyback or cash returns?
Jeff Su
OK. So Charlie's first question is that although there's cyclicality, the long-term outlook appears good. Would the company consider doing a share buyback?
Wendell Huang -- Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yes, Charlie, we constantly review all the different options of returning cash to shareholders. For share buyback, at this moment, we are not considering it. We think our cash on hand will be better kept to invest in our capital expenditure to make a better return for our shareholders.
Charlie Chan -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst
OK, understood. Thank you. And also, my second question is also about the U.S. sanction impact? I know the company said that NPAs limited and the long-term impact remains to be seen, right, but my question is about your -- the China market to TSMC, is that as strategic as before after these events?
Jeff Su
OK, so Charlie, second question, he wants to know with the recent U.S. regulations and the impact, how do we see the China market? Is it still a strategic market for TSMC? Is that correct, Charlie?
Charlie Chan -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst
Yes, meaning whether -- how this company think about China for TSMC's long-term picture, how important it is to China going forward?
C.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer
Charlie, I would like to say that every region is important to TSMC. However, let me say that, under the condition of work compliance with all the rules and regulations, TSMC will continue to serve all the customer all over the world. That's our position.
Charlie Chan -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst
OK, including China?
C.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer
All the customers.
Charlie Chan -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst
OK, got it. Thank you. Those are my questions. Thank you.
Jeff Su
Thank you, Charlie. Operator, can we move onto the next participant, please.
Operator
Next one to ask questions, Sunny Lin from UBS.
Sunny Lin -- UBS -- Analyst
Hi, thank you for taking my questions. Congrats on the steady performance. My first question is on the geopolitical tensions. I wonder, given some of the considerations regarding the geopolitical issues, how would you evaluate a longer-term impact from customers potentially diversifying from Asian foundries? And how are you managing the risk? Thank you.
Jeff Su
OK, so Sunny's first question is that given the geopolitical tensions, how do we evaluate the long-term impact and the risk of customers using other foundries? Is that correct, Sunny?
Sunny Lin -- UBS -- Analyst
Correct. Thank you.
C.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer
Sunny, we still believe the most important is in is a technology leadership, manufacturing and our customer trust. And so in different locations, manufacturing or whatever, we still think that technology leadership is the most important thing. And so that's our strategy. We make it simple, the technology, manufacturing and customer trust.
Sunny Lin -- UBS -- Analyst
Got it. And so a quick follow-up. Is that going forward, should we assume an acceleration of your overseas expansions just to diversify the production site, i.e., if there could be a fab built in Europe?
Jeff Su
OK, so Sunny's second question then, does that -- can we assume that we will continue to increase the overseas global footprint expansion and also particularly in Europe?
C.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer
Well, we will continue to increase our overseas portion in manufacturing based on customers' need, in fact, based on the business opportunity and also based on the operations efficiency and economics. And so whether we are going to be in Europe, we are in preliminary evaluation and to not rule out any possibility. Again, I would like to say the decision were based on customers' need, business opportunities, operational efficiency and the cost economics.
Sunny Lin -- UBS -- Analyst
Got it, thank you. I actually have a second question on HPC. So with the increasing usage of chiplets, how would you manage the risk in the case that some dies are made at the other foundries and that have production issues and therefore, impacting the production at TSMC as well? Thank you very much.
Jeff Su
So, Sunny, second question is with increasing usage and adoption of shipments -- sorry, chiplets in HPC, how would we manage the risk in case I think Sunny you're saying it dies at other companies or places have production issues, would how do we manage the risk of that impacting TSMC?
C.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer
Sunny, in fact, we would like our customer manufacturing every chip inside TSMC for sure. But if there is a case that they have to use other companies' dies, we will work with our customers closely and minimize all the risk that some goes by. That's what we are doing right now.
Sunny Lin -- UBS -- Analyst
Got it. Thank you, that's very helpful. Thank you.
Jeff Su
Thank you, Sunny. Operator, can we move on to the next participant, please.
Operator
Right now, we have Laura Chen from Citi.
Laura Chen -- Citi -- Analyst
Thank you, for taking my question. I appreciate that if you can share with your latest plan in your Nanjing fab. Like C.C. already mentioned, you got the license for the 28-nanometer in Nanjing.
So I'm just wondering that do you also need a license for the 16-nanometer in the Nanjing fab? And also going forward, what's your trend of your operation in China? That's my first question. Thank you.
Jeff Su
OK, so Laura's first question is about Nanjing fab and our plans. She notes that we have received the one-year authorization. So our 28-nanometer expansion continues as planned. Her question is, do we also need a license for the 16-nanometer that we have in Nanjing? And then also her -- also what is our long-term future expansion plans in China.
Wendell Huang -- Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Sunny, let me answer the first part.
Jeff Su
Laura.
Wendell Huang -- Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Sorry, it's Laura. Let me answer the first part. The one-year authorization that we received cover the Nanjing facility. So it's both the 28 and 16.
Laura Chen -- Citi -- Analyst
OK, great. Thank you.
Jeff Su
And then the second part is what is our long-term expansion plans for China?
Wendell Huang -- Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
OK. As C.C. said, we will be operating -- serving all the customers under the condition that we will fully follow in compliance with all the rules and regulations.
Laura Chen -- Citi -- Analyst
OK, that's very clear. My second question is also about the fab globally in the longer term. We know that in overseas operation, usually, they will have a much higher operational cost. So how would that impact the TSMC's long-term margin trend in our view, or maybe you can give us some information about your estimate of the percentage of the margin in different region or the cost difference comparing to Taiwan?
Jeff Su
OK, so Laura's second question is around our expansion of our global manufacturing footprint. She wants to know that overseas fabs, are the costs higher? Do we have a breakdown how much the cost difference is in Japan, U.S. versus Taiwan? And then overall, with overseas expansion and if there are higher costs, how does this impact our long-term profitability and margin?
Wendell Huang -- Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
OK, Laura, let me answer this question. The initial cost of overseas fabs are indeed higher than TSMC's fab in Taiwan. And it's mainly because of higher labor costs in different layers of the supply chain. We continue to work closely with the U.S.
government, as well as with our customers and supply chain partner to manage and minimize the cost gap. Now through these efforts, we believe we can continue to earn the proper return and deliver the long-term gross margin of 53% and higher.
Laura Chen -- Citi -- Analyst
OK, that's very clear. Thank you very much.
Jeff Su
Thank you, Laura. Operator, can we move on to the next participant, please.
Operator
Next one to ask questions is Rolf Bulk from New Street Research.
Rolf Bulk -- New Street Research -- Analyst
Thank you for taking the question. I was hoping you could give some more context around the 3-nanometer tool shortages that you mentioned. Is that primarily lithography, and then specifically EUV related, or do you also see shortages in other tool segments? Thank you.
Jeff Su
OK. So Rolf's first question is around 3-nanometer and the tool shortages. He wants to know if this is very -- just specific to lithography tools and EUV specifically, or is it more I guess, broad-based?
C.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer
Let me answer the question. Actually, it's more broad based because of our demand is high -- and certainly, the photo lithography tool is included and one of the most important one.
Rolf Bulk -- New Street Research -- Analyst
Thank you. That's reasonable. As my follow-up question, it would be great to get an update on your N2 notes, which your current visibility is now it's still on track timing-wise and is there anything you can share on how you think about yields of N2 versus N5 and N3 at the same stage of development?
Jeff Su
OK, so Rolf's second question is on N2. He would like an update. Are we still on track? What is the timing for N2? And also if there's any update on yields as compared to N3 and N5 at similar stage.
C.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer
OK, I said before, N2 is a very deep quarter one, but our progress so far, so good. Actually, it's a little bit ahead. And we are going to have a mass production introduced in 2025. And our customers' engagement so far are very -- let me say that, comparable with the N3, N5.
And the status today is very comparable to the N5 and also N3. So we are happy to see that our progress so far.
Jeff Su
Does that answer your question, Rolf?
Rolf Bulk -- New Street Research -- Analyst
Thank you very much.
Jeff Su
Thank you, Rolf. OK. Operator, let's move on to the next participant, please.
Operator
Next one, we have Charles Shi from Needham & Company.
Charles Shi -- Needham and Company -- Analyst
Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions. I have two, both on capex. The first question is really -- and I understand you're not here to guide 2023 capex.
But I think a few years ago, you did provide some long-term capex, a range of capex when your long-term CAGR guidance was 5% to 10%. And you think 10 to 12 billion capex is going to support that long-term CAGR. I think you just reiterated your long-term CAGR to be 15% to 20%. Do you kind of have a similar range of capex for us to think about over long term? Again, I'm not asking you about '23 capex year.
Jeff Su
OK, so Charles' first question is about -- really, I think, Charles, you're asking about capex correlation with growth. So he notes that. In the past, we have said our long-term growth would be 5% to 10%. So during that period, we said we would spend between TWD 10 billion to TWD 12 billion.
So without asking about 2023 specifically, Charles wants to know, now we believe we will grow between 15% to 20% CAGR in the next few years. What type of capex range does that imply or should he assume? Is that correct, Charles?
Charles Shi -- Needham and Company -- Analyst
Yes, correct.
Wendell Huang -- Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
OK, Charles, I think it will be -- let me try to answer this question from the capital intensity point of view. When we invest heavily to capture the future growth, the capital intensity will be high like last year and this year. But if the growth slows down, the capital intensity may become lower. Now longer term wise, we think that a normal reasonable capital intensity may be somewhere between mid to high 30 percentages longer-term-wise.
Charles Shi -- Needham and Company -- Analyst
The second question is about very near term into the next quarter basically because you just slashed your 2022 capex, I mean from what you guided one quarter ago by about 4 billion. If I hear correctly, half of that is can be attributed to the tool delivery issues. But the other half, can you clarify a little bit, because you kind of said it's about capacity optimization. Is that the kind of like a 2 billion reduction in capex, mostly a reduction of the equipment spending, or is it something else you are reducing here and trying to improve the capital capacity optimization here? Thank you.
Jeff Su
OK, so Charles' second question is on the capex and he is asking we have now guided to around 36 billion versus close to 40 billion last time. We have said half of it is related to tool delivery and the other half is capacity optimization for the midterm demand outlook. So his question is with the capacity optimization is this mainly also a reduction in tools, or is there some other issue right? Is that correct, Charles?
Charles Shi -- Needham and Company -- Analyst
Yes, correct. Thank you.
Wendell Huang -- Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
OK. Charles, I think the -- you're right that the half of that difference comes from tool delivery issue. The other half is the capacity optimization by that, and that's because of the current uncertainty in market conditions. So we're tightening up our capital budget.
And it relates to the whole capacity. It's including tools, including the other stuff within the capex. Yes, and it's mainly N7.
Charles Shi -- Needham and Company -- Analyst
Thank you very much.
Jeff Su
Yes, it's tools and also as C.C. and Wendell mentioned, some of the adjustments we have made to our N7 and N6 capacity and capex due to the aforementioned reasons. Thanks. OK, thank you, Charles.
Operator, can we move on to the next participant.

Next one, we have Brad Lin from BofA Securities. Go ahead, please.
Brad Lin -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst
Thank you very much for taking my questions. First of all, congratulations on the strong earnings, and my first question is about, well, if we look at the loan pages of the new regulations from the U.S. on China, it can be really broad and with the -- of course, with the key on the supercomputing. But however, given the wide variety and also wider application of chips that TSMC makes, isn't it, in theory, difficult to identify and make sure the chipset is business compliant with the regulation, or will there be some extra costs and overhead costs by that which wish you notice in the future? Thank you.
That's my first question.
Jeff Su
OK. So Brad's first question is with the new U.S. regulations, he knows it's very long and very wide in scope. So he is wondering if it's very hard to interpret and therefore, will this result in greater overhead cost for TSMC to ensure that we are and continue to be fully compliant with all the regulations.
C.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer
Well, actually, although it's rule is about more than 100 pages, but initial region and feedback from our customer, actually, the regulation is very simple to be understood like control switch hold at a very high-end specification. For example, like 600 bit per second bandwidth or those kind of things, it's very easily to be understood, and we continue to work with our customers to make sure that we fully comply with the regulation.
Jeff Su
And so Brad would also like to know, Wendell, from a financial standpoint, will we incur more overhead cost as a result?
Wendell Huang -- Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
At this moment, we don't think so.
Brad Lin -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst
I see, thank you very much. Just a slight follow-up because the regulation is just aiming at the first supercomputing, but I know in a supercomputer, definitely, there are some -- still some low-end chips used inside. So if we happen to make those, and we are not sure that it is going there when we produce them with that, will that cause some confusion or bring some trouble to us?
Jeff Su
So Brad's second question is in a super computer, there may be very specific high-end restrictions, but there's also companion chips, other chips used. Would that cause us an issue?
C.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer
The company achieved, there is no restriction or no regulation at all. So we reran on our customer to work with their own customer for that kind of a product.
Brad Lin -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst
Got it. Thank you very much. And then maybe, if I may, second question will be clearly, many countries would like to build their own foundry or their own domestic supply chain. We have learned that the cost will be a major downside.
So my question would be can we charge different pricing that's basically demanded by our clients, right? So with higher costs, if they want to buy from U.S. or buy from Europe, can we charge a higher pricing if that's based on the node? And also, if we think about the bright side, would you please share how TSMC could well utilize these kind of opportunities to strengthen our competitiveness in the long run? That will be my all questions.
Jeff Su
So Brad's second question is about he notes that many countries would like to have domestic semiconductor manufacturing. TSMC, we are, as C.C. said, also increasing and expanding our global manufacturing footprint. So with higher cost, will we be able to charge a higher price? I guess that is essentially his question.
C.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer
Actually, TSMC's pricing is strategic and consistent, and all I can say is we will continue to see our value. The values come from the technology manufacturing, and also that our relationship with our customers, whether it is in a different country or a different place, it's not in our consideration. Again, I would like to say we'll continue to see our value and our pricing is strategic. OK?
Jeff Su
OK. Thank you, Brad. Operator, can we move on to the next participant, please.
Operator
Next one, we have Mehdi Hosseini from Susquehanna International.
Mehdi Hosseini -- Susquehanna International Group -- Analyst
Yes, thanks for taking my questions. I also have my first multipart question. I'm just looking at your customers' inventories that are on a days of inventory are at a 25-year high. And it seems based on your commentary that the demand forecast, especially looking at the first half, has weakened.
So it seems to me that the inventory correction is going to sustain to Q2 and more slightly, your shipment would be declining sequentially in Q1 and Q2. Just looking at your customers' inventory, is that a realistic view of the first half? Because you also highlighted the fact that inventory correction is going to sustain throughout the first half. And we're not asking for a guide, I'm just trying to better reconcile your customers' inventory with your comment. And I have a follow-up.
Jeff Su
OK, so Mehdi's first question is on inventory. He notes customers' inventory levels are very high. We have talked about our observation from an industry level that demand is softening in consumer segment. And so his question is what is the outlook and do we expect the inventory correction, I guess, to be more notable as we go into first half '23.
Is that correct, Mehdi?
Mehdi Hosseini -- Susquehanna International Group -- Analyst
Yes, and particularly, you've always had your wafer shipment up in Q2, but I think '23 could be an exception, and it could probably decline. And that's how I explained my question. So the question is could wafer shipment decline in Q2 for the first time in many, many years.
C.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer
Well, Mehdi, our current forecast, actually, our supply chain inventory will peak in third quarter this year. And we observed that the inventory will start to reduce in the fourth quarter -- last quarter of this year. And we expect we will see the biggest impact in the first half, actually, first half of 2023. The detail of the first quarter, second quarter or something like that, we are not ready to share with you yet because of -- we continue to work with our customer and to understand their demand.
Mehdi Hosseini -- Susquehanna International Group -- Analyst
And if I may have a quick follow-up to that? Does that imply that your customer focus changing so rapidly that we have to wait for January pulse to get the final read on the first half?
Jeff Su
No, Mehdi. I think we have always in the past, we will guide for 2023 and talk about 2023 outlook in first quarter during the January conference, right? But I think C.C. has already said that with the inventory correction, we expect our business to be more resilient during both the down and upturn given our technology leadership, and that 2023 is a growth year for TSMC, OK? We will not comment further on first quarter or second quarter.
Mehdi Hosseini -- Susquehanna International Group -- Analyst
And my second question has to do with depreciation that was down in Q3, down year over year and Q-over-Q. And this is despite the fact that capex was up 65% in 2021. Does that have anything to do with tool optimization? And to that extent, as the second part of the question, would you consider converting 7-nanometer to five and three?
Jeff Su
So, Mehdi's, second question first is depreciation, why it is down Q-on-Q and year on year. And then also, would we consider converting capacity?
Wendell Huang -- Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
OK. Mehdi, the depreciation, we look at it from a whole year point of view. For this year, as I mentioned, we expect it to be up year on year by mid-single digits of -- and for next year, it will be meaningfully higher, meaningfully higher, but we will share with you more in January. Please understand that every year, there are depreciation newly going into the depreciation table and also there are depreciation coming off of the depreciation table.
So what you're looking at is the net result. As to converting N7 capacity to N5, as we mentioned earlier, N7 demand issue is cyclical rather than structural. So at this moment, I don't think we have that kind of plan.
Jeff Su
Thank you, Mehdi. In the interest of time, operator, maybe we can take the last -- the questions from the last two participants, please?
Operator
Yes, sir. Next one to ask a question, Patrick Chen from CLSA. Go ahead, please.
Patrick Chen -- CLSA -- Analyst
Thank you for taking my questions. You talked about 2023 to be still a growth year. Would you say that growth is pretty much the same compared to what you expected a quarter ago or it is lower? And if so, what's driving this lower growth expectation?
Jeff Su
OK, so Patrick's first question is about 2023. Is the growth that we see for 2023, how does it compare versus our expectation for three months ago for 2023? And what is driving this?
Wendell Huang -- Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yes, well, I think it's too early to talk too much about the 2023, but we maintain our statement that 2023, we still expect as a growth year, OK?
Jeff Su
Do you have a second question, Patrick?
Patrick Chen -- CLSA -- Analyst
OK. Yes, that's very helpful. And maybe a follow-up. If I may, any leading indicators that you are monitoring that could help you or help us determine the growth outlook aside from monitoring the clients' wafer orders?
Jeff Su
OK, so Patrick's second question is looking with inventory correction. He wants to know if there's any leading indicators that we can look at or he should look at to see when indication that the cycle is bottoming.
C.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer
That's really hard to answer your question. Actually, if you look at the whole industry, that's from the smartphone and PCs, and you read all the quarterly report from our major player, you can change that one to go up and one is the downturn. So we definitely have some information. Internally, we do the analysis, and today, we are taking a very conservative way for our planning.
That's all I can share with you.
Patrick Chen -- CLSA -- Analyst
Thank you. And I guess that's what we've been doing as well. But obviously, we don't have a crystal ball. Well I don't have any further question.
Thank you for taking my questions.
Jeff Su
OK, thank you. Operator, can we take the last participant, please?
Operator
Yes, the last one to ask question is Frank Lee from HSBC. Go ahead, please.
Frank Lee -- HSBC -- Analyst
Thank you. I wanted to ask, I guess, a question on your N3, N3E. Is the ramp for both nodes going to be around the same time, or is there going to be some difference in scheduling?
Jeff Su
OK, so Frank's first question is on the ramp for N3 versus N3E, is it at the same time.
C.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer
OK. Actually, it's not at the same time. Right now, we are ramping up by N3. And N3E is supposed to be one-year apart, but because of the progress so well, so we might pull in a little bit for two or three months, that's all.
So they are still not at the same time.
Frank Lee -- HSBC -- Analyst
OK, and my second question is, I know you've related your margin -- long-term gross margin target being unchanged. But I guess given the headwinds you're seeing now through the first half of next year with the currency move already gone up quite a bit, utilization rates dropping. Is this -- are you going to see any potential change in the pricing strategy? I know I can't comment too specifically, but you have seen some price increases in the last 12 months or so. So from going forward, with the pricing strategy still be relatively unchanged given the change in the overall market environment?
Jeff Su
OK, so Frank's second question is related to pricing with the inventory correction and with some of the cost challenges, he wants to know, will there be any changes to our pricing strategy during this correction. Is that correct, Frank?
Frank Lee -- HSBC -- Analyst
Yes.
C.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer
OK, Frank, let me answer the question. Again, I want to stress that our pricing actually is a strategic and consistent. So you say that do we have any plan to change it? No, it will be consistent. And not based on any cycle or opportunistic.
And we actually -- most importantly, we always work closely with our customers to provide our value and to help them to win their own end markets.
Frank Lee -- HSBC -- Analyst
Right -- no, I'm not suggesting there's an opportunistic pricing, but I just get a market situation has changed for your clients who are probably going through a more difficult time. Would there be some change to the strides to help align with them as well? Or would they largely still be the same policy that we've seen?
C.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer
We stay the same. We are consistent.
Frank Lee -- HSBC -- Analyst
OK. Thank you.
Jeff Su
Thank you, Frank. All right. This concludes our Q&A session. Before we conclude today's conference, please be advised that the replay of the conference will be accessible within one hour from now.
The transcript will become available 24 hours from now, both of which will be available through TSMC's website at www.tsmc.com. Thank you for joining us today, and we hope you will join us again next quarter. Goodbye, and have a good day.

All earnings call transcripts",10069,"Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to TSMC's third quarter 2022 earnings conference call. I’m Jeff Su, TSMC's Director of Investor Relations. Today’s event is being webcast, with an audio version and earnings materials available on our website.

I’ll briefly cover today’s format. TSMC’s CFO, Mr. Wendell Huang, will provide a summary of our operations and guidance for the next quarter. This will be followed by a joint presentation of key messages from Mr. Huang and our CEO, Dr. C.C. Wei. We will then open the floor for a Q&A session.

Before we proceed, I’d like to remind everyone that today’s discussion will contain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. For a detailed discussion of these risks, please refer to our official disclosures.

I will now hand over to Mr. Wendell Huang for the financial overview and guidance.

Thank you, Jeff, and good afternoon to all. I’ll start with the financial highlights for Q3. Our revenue increased by 14.8% sequentially in NTD, or 11.4% in USD, buoyed by strong demand for our 5-nanometer technology. The gross margin rose to 60.4%, thanks to favorable exchange rates and cost improvement efforts.

Our operating expenses were 9.8% of total revenue, slightly improved from the previous quarter. Our EPS stood at TWD 10.83, and our return on equity reached 42.9%.

Delving into technology-specific revenues, the 5-nanometer process contributed 28% of total wafer revenue, with 7-nanometer technologies accounting for 26%. We experienced robust quarter-over-quarter growth across major platforms, especially in the smartphone and IoT segments.

Looking at our balance sheet, we closed the quarter with TWD 1.5 trillion in cash and marketable securities. Current liabilities decreased, mainly due to reductions in short-term loans. On cash flow, we generated approximately TWD 413 billion from operations and spent TWD 266 billion in capital expenditures.

For Q4 guidance, we expect revenue between $19.9 billion and $20.7 billion, with a gross margin between 59.5% and 61.5%, and an operating margin between 49% and 51%.

Now, for our key messages: Despite inflationary pressures and exchange rate impacts, we anticipate our gross margin in Q4 to remain stable around 60.5%. We face challenges such as depreciation costs and cyclical industry dynamics, which we are addressing through strategic customer collaboration and internal cost controls.

For our 2022 capital expenditures, we anticipate spending around $36 billion, aimed primarily at advanced technologies.

Dr. Wei will now provide further details on our market outlook and technological advancements.

Thank you, Mr. Huang. The demand for our 5-nanometer technologies remains robust, with steady demand anticipated from both the smartphone and HPC sectors. We project our full-year growth to be in the mid-30s in USD terms.

Looking into 2023, while we expect some market adjustments, we predict a growth year for TSMC, driven by continuing strong demand for our advanced technologies. Despite the ongoing adjustments in semiconductor inventory levels, our leading-edge technologies and strategic customer relationships position us for resilient performance.

In conclusion, TSMC maintains its commitment to supporting our customers’ growth and enhancing our technology leadership. This approach ensures long-term growth and sustains our competitive advantage in the global market.

Welcome to MACOM's Fourth Fiscal Quarter 2021 Conference Call. This call is being recorded today, Thursday, November 4, 2021. [Operator Instructions]
I will now turn the call to Mr. Steve Ferranti, MACOM's Vice President of Strategic Initiatives and Investor Relations. Mr. Ferranti, please go ahead.
Stephen Ferranti -- Vice President of Investor Relation
Thank you, Olivia. Good morning, and welcome to our call to discuss MACOM's Fourth Fiscal Quarter and Fiscal Year 2021 Financial Results. I would like to remind everyone that our discussion today will contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to certain risks and uncertainties as defined in the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today. For a more detailed discussion of the risks and uncertainties that could result in those differences, we refer you to MACOM's filings with the SEC. Management's statements during this call will also include discussion of certain adjusted non-GAAP financial information. A reconciliation of GAAP to adjusted non-GAAP results are provided in the company's press release and related Form 8-K, which was filed with the SEC today.
With that, I'll turn over the call to Steve Daly, President and CEO of MACOM.
Stephen G. Daly -- President and Chief Executive Officer and Director
Thank you, Steve, and good morning. I will begin today's call with a general company update. After that, Jack Kober, our Chief Financial Officer, will provide a more in-depth review of our fourth quarter and full year results for fiscal 2021. When Jack is finished, I will provide revenue and earnings guidance for the first fiscal quarter of 2022, and then we will be happy to take some questions. Our fourth fiscal quarter financial results represent continued improvements in overall performance. Revenue for Q4 was $155.2 million and adjusted EPS was $0.61 per diluted share. Notably, we exceeded 30% adjusted operating margin, which is an important milestone for the MACOM team. With another quarter of strong cash flow, we ended our fiscal year with $345 million in cash and short-term investments on our balance sheet. For the full fiscal year ending October 1, 2021, revenue was $607 million, and adjusted EPS was $2.15 per diluted share. We are pleased to report 14.5% year-over-year revenue growth and 126% year-over-year earnings growth. Our financial results this year would not have been possible without the hard work and dedication of all our employees.
In spite of certain supply chain challenges and COVID-19 headwinds, we met our internal corporate goals, our new product development schedules and our revenue and earnings targets. I would like to thank the entire team for their extraordinary efforts and commitment. MACOM is fortunate to have such a hard-working and dedicated management team and employees. Our Q4 and full year book-to-bill ratio was 1.2:1 and our turns business was approximately 13% of total revenue. We believe that the strong Q4 bookings reflect market share gains, a few large long-term IND orders, which we'll ship over multiple quarters, as well as orders being placed by customers one or two quarters ahead of required ship dates due to longer than normal manufacturing cycle times. Our strong bookings over the course of FY '21 allows us to start FY '22 with a higher-than-typical backlog. We continue to manage various supply related interruptions and challenges due to COVID-19 and production capacity limitations with certain semiconductor, package and substrate technologies.
Our operations, planning and logistics teams have done an excellent job managing through these industry dynamics, and they are working around the clock to meet customer commitments. Fiscal Q4 revenue by end market was generally as expected, with Industrial & Defense at $75.1 million, Telecom at $46.6 million and Data Center at $33.5 million. I&D was up 5% sequentially, Telecom was down 3% sequentially and Data Center was up around 1% sequentially. For fiscal year 2021, I&D was up 44%, Data Center up 10% and Telecom down 10%. In FY '21, our top 10 end customers represented 26.5% of our total revenue, and our revenue concentration on any one product was less than 1.6% of our total revenue. We maintain a diversified technology portfolio as well as a very diversified customer base with thousands of customers. Our Industrial & Defense end market performed well during fiscal Q4 and for the 2021 fiscal year. Our success in this end market is the result of the efforts that we began in 2019 within our engineering groups to revitalize our portfolio of RF and microwave products, including increasing the of base of new product introduction, expanding to fill in the gaps of our product lines, developing new innovative technologies and reengaging major customers with a more focused sales and marketing effort.
More recently, we also began ramping up efforts to cross-sell our optical and high-performance analog products to Industrial & Defense customers, which creates a sizable growth opportunity for us. Overall, I am pleased with the level of engagement our sales and business development teams have had at major defense OEMs over the last few quarters, involving a variety of ground, airborne, ship-based programs, including radar, electronic warfare, avionics and RF and optical communication applications. These programs are typically long life cycle programs, and we expect they will contribute to our growth in FY '22 and beyond. Our Telecom end market revenue was slightly down in Q4 primarily due to softness in the 5G market, which was offset by strong demand in broadband access and DOCSIS 3.1 cable TV infrastructure markets. MACOM has a broad CATV product portfolio, including single lended and differential amplifiers, transformers, power dividers, combiners, couplers and Dyflex filters. 5G represents a large growth opportunity for MACOM as worldwide demand for improved connectivity at higher data rates grows.
In addition, we see growth opportunities in PON, CATV infrastructure, microwave radios and SATCOM during FY '22, primarily driven by strong end market dynamics, new product introductions and market share gains. Our Data Center end market revenue was essentially flat in Q4. Nevertheless, we believe Data Center remains a large growth opportunity for MACOM. We expect new product introductions will be the primary driver for growth for us in this market. Some examples include 25G DFB lasers and 50G CW lasers, photodetectors, laser drivers and transimpedance amplifiers. I'll note that earlier this week, we announced a new linear equalizer product line, which will support high data rate applications, including active copper cables used inside the Data Center. We believe our strategy to collaborate with leading DSP chip suppliers allows MACOM to stay focused on designing and producing the industry's next-generation high-speed TIAs and laser drivers. I'll note with the ramp-up of 400G ZR and Data Center interconnects, we are seeing an increased interest in the development of coherent solutions for next-generation 800G and higher data rates for connections, both between and within Data Centers.
Coherent ZR technology typically utilizes silicon photonic optics, along with a coherent DSP to transmit a QAM modulated optical signal on a single wavelength. MACOM is a leading merchant supplier of modulator drivers and linear TIAs for coherent modules, and we are currently in volume production with 32 gigabaud, 64 gigabaud and 96 gigabaud product families. We are also beginning to see the proliferation of coherent optics into the access market with low-cost tunable 100G solutions. As a merchant supplier, we are working with our module customers in the Data Center and enterprise markets to support their development of coherent optics with our existing product portfolio and are developing new products as the requirements for higher bandwidth continues to emerge across all market segments. We had many technical accomplishments in fiscal 2021, and I would like to highlight a few. First, we internally documented 43 new invention disclosures, we formally submitted 49 new patent applications to the U.S. patent office, and we were awarded 44 new patents.
Innovation and invention is critical to our future success and I would like to congratulate our engineering community for their excellent work in this area. Second, during the year, we introduced over 130 standard products, and we expect to grow product introductions in FY '22 by an additional 35%. In addition, we had great success with our custom IC development activities, which complements the build-out of our standard product portfolio. During the year, we supported approximately 20 customer-funded major IC developments and many smaller unfunded projects. Further, I am pleased to provide a progress report on four important strategic technology developments. First, our 0.14 GaN on Silicon Carbide process transfer from AFRL is on plan, and our fab and device engineering teams have done remarkable work over the past 12 months. To date, we have verified the processes' small signal performance. And more importantly, we have measured over 4.5 watts per millimeter at 25 volts at expand frequencies. We believe this power density performance is extremely competitive. In the coming months, we will be optimizing the process with a goal to achieve even higher power level.
I'll note, we have recently designed a MMIC power amplifier and processed it on both the AFRL and MACOM process. And with the exception of power levels, we have almost identical performance. During FY '22, we plan to complete the installation of new backside process equipment as well as installing atomic layer deposition or ALD capability for device passivation. We recognize we have a lot of work ahead. However, our engineering results to date are compelling, and we believe in time, we will capture market share in the high-frequency GaN MMIC market. Second, we are making excellent progress on our silicon photonics product development. As I reported last quarter, we are now working with our fab partner on producibility and yields. Third, our pure carbide high-power GaN amplifier product line continues to expand since its introduction over one year ago.
Notably, we recently released three additional high-power products including a 60-watt narrowband C-band product for RADAR and two general purpose, 15-watt broadband products operating at DC to 12 gigahertz and 30 megahertz to 3.5 gigahertz. And last, as a reminder, our 1,000 volt chip capacitor product line or KV CAPS, is fully production released, and we are beginning to take orders and gain traction in the market. KV CAPS are ideal for high-voltage applications where small size and reliability is critical. As we look ahead to fiscal year 2022, our priorities include: further accelerating and streamlining our new product development process, gaining market share by staying focused on addressing customer needs and providing continuous engineering support, strengthening our competitive advantage by introducing new products based on MACOM's proprietary semiconductor processes, increasing our direct business with major OEMs and further optimizing the efficiency of our operations to improve profitability and cash flow.
Our organization is lean and can move quickly to ensure we capture market share. We believe that making modest internal investments in our business can provide opportunities to achieve higher-than-average return on invested capital. And therefore, supports our goal of establishing best-in-class profitability. The risk-to-reward ratios on these internal investments can be compelling since they leverage existing assets that we already have in place. For example, we are investing in our Massachusetts and Michigan wafer fabs to modernize, develop new process technologies, improve quality and expand capacity. We believe investments in new and existing process technologies like 0.14 and 90-nanometer GaN on silicon carbide, or high-voltage capacitors, will enable differentiation across our RF and optical products, which ultimately supports our goals of very profitable growth. Related to our wafer fab investment, we are pleased to announce that our low wafer fab recently achieved IATF16949 certification for automotive quality management systems.
As a reminder, this certification focuses on defect prevention, waste reduction and supply chain management for the international automotive industry. We believe this certification will help to open new doors for us in the automotive industry. In particular, we believe our lightwave, RF and microwave, KV capacitor and high-speed analog technologies are ideal for automotive applications such as sensors, LiDAR, under-the-hood power management and autonomous driving applications. In addition to investing in our fab facilities, we're also expanding our assembly, new product prototyping and engineering test capabilities at some of our other facilities. For example, we anticipate that our Nashua, New Hampshire facility will expand its manufacturing operations space by 100% over the next 12 months. This facility supports a wide range of commercial and defense-related product development and production programs. In addition, we just opened a new state-of-the-art product engineering and application lab at our Newport Beach, California facility. All of these activities require strong and expanding workforces, and we have not been standing still in hiring. We are focused on expanding R&D with best-in-class talent. And as an example, in fiscal year '21, we hired over a dozen PhDs to join our already strong workforce.
In summary, MACOM has a wide range of products in production today, spanning dozens of different product lines, serving thousands of customers. Many of these products have long life cycles and produced revenue for years after they've been introduced. We view this diversity of technology, products and end market applications as an inherent strength of the company, helping to provide a broad revenue base.
Jack will now provide a more detailed review of our financial results.
John F. Kober -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. We continued the trend of improving profitability during the fourth fiscal quarter ended October 1, 2021. Revenue, gross margin, operating margin and earnings per share all showed improvement on a sequential and year-over-year basis. Adjusted operating margin exceeded 30%, which is a notable milestone for the company. Revenue for the fourth quarter was $155.2 million, up 1.7% quarter-over-quarter. As expected, the sequential improvement in revenue was driven primarily by an increase in Industrial & Defense. Data Center was up modestly, partially offset by a modest decline in Telecom end markets. For the full fiscal year, revenue was $607 million in fiscal 2021, up 14.5% from $530 million in fiscal 2020. On a geographic basis, domestic customers represented approximately 46% of both our fiscal Q4 and fiscal year 2021 results. These amounts represent increases from the approximate 36% and 41% of sales to domestic customers in fiscal Q4 2020 and fiscal year 2020, respectively.
Adjusted gross profit in fiscal Q4 was $94.9 million or 61.1% of revenue, up another 80 basis points sequentially. Adjusted gross margin for the full fiscal year 2021 was 59.6%, up 460 basis points from 55% in fiscal 2020. The strong gross margin performance for fiscal year 2021 was the result of a variety of ongoing initiatives that we've touched on in the past. We have numerous internal actions focused on improving the efficiency of our operations, including optimizing yields, reducing scrap, cycle time enhancements and supply chain management. We have also been focused on pricing across our pipeline and customer base. We believe all of these efforts will support our gross margins to continue to be above 60% and over time, further contribute to additional gains in gross margins. Total adjusted operating expense was $48.1 million, consisting of R&D expense of $30.2 million and SG&A expense of $17.9 million. Total operating expenses were sequentially flat from fiscal Q3 levels. For fiscal year 2021, total adjusted operating expense was $191.2 million, down 2.4% from fiscal year 2020 levels. For fiscal year 2022, we believe that -- operating expenses will increase as we expand sales and marketing activities and enhance our R&D capabilities by investing in new programs to support our future growth while also continuing to be very disciplined with our discretionary spending. Adjusted operating income in fiscal Q4 was $46.8 million, up from $43.9 million in fiscal Q3.
Adjusted operating margin was 30.2% for fiscal Q4, sequentially up from 28.7% in Q3. Adjusted operating margin in excess of 30% represents a new record for MACOM since we went public back in 2012. For fiscal year 2021, adjusted operating income was $170.3 million compared to $96 million for fiscal 2020, representing 77% year-over-year increase. Depreciation expense for fiscal Q4 was $5.7 million and adjusted EBITDA was $52.5 million. For fiscal year 2021, our last 12 months adjusted EBITDA was $194 million as compared to $124.5 million in fiscal 2020, representing a 56% increase year-over-year. Adjusted net interest expense for fiscal Q4 was $1.4 million, sequentially flat from fiscal Q3. Fiscal year 2021 adjusted net interest expense was $11 million, down from $23.3 million in 2020, primarily due to the restructuring of debt in March of 2021. Our adjusted income tax rate in fiscal Q4 remained at 5% and resulted in an expense of approximately $2.3 million. Our cash tax payments were $200,000 for the fourth quarter and $1.6 million for fiscal year 2021. We expect our adjusted income tax rate to remain at 5% for fiscal 2022.
Fiscal Q4 adjusted net income was $43.3 million compared to $40.3 million in fiscal Q3. Adjusted earnings fully diluted share was $0.61, utilizing a share count of 71.1 million shares compared to $0.57 of adjusted earnings per share in fiscal Q3. For fiscal year 2021, adjusted net income was $151.9 million, more than double fiscal year 2020 income of $67.1 million. Fiscal year adjusted EPS was $2.15 compared to $0.98 in fiscal year 2020. Now moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow items. Our Q4 accounts receivable balance was $84.6 million, up from $71.6 million in fiscal Q3. As a result, days sales outstanding were 49 days. Our accounts receivable balance reflects an increase over prior periods as our revenue has been increasing and also due to more shipments occurring later in the quarter as compared to prior quarters. Inventories $82.7 million at quarter end, down a little less than $1 million sequentially. Inventory turns were flat sequentially at 2.9 times during the fourth fiscal quarter. Our fiscal Q4 cash flow from operations of approximately $40.8 million was down $4.1 million sequentially, primarily due to the increase in accounts receivable balances.
Capital expenditures totaled $5 million in fiscal Q4. Fiscal 2021 capex of $18 million was up slightly from $17.6 million in fiscal 2020, primarily attributable to investments in our fabs as well as R&D infrastructure. We expect capex to increase in fiscal year '22 and be in the range of $30 million to $35 million as we continue to invest in our internal fab and production capabilities as well as R&D equivalent. Free cash flow was $35.8 million for the fourth fiscal quarter and $130.5 million for fiscal 2021. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments for the fourth fiscal quarter were $345 million, up $36 million from fiscal Q3 and up by $11.8 million versus the same quarter in the prior year. As a reminder, in March 2021, we repaid $100 million of our outstanding term loans and also entered into a $450 million convertible note arrangement, utilizing the proceeds to further pay down our outstanding term loans. Our long-term debt currently consists of $450 million of convertible notes due in 2026 and $121 million remaining on our term loans due in 2024. Neither of these arrangements require any principal repayments until the maturity.
We also have $29 million of finance leases. With the improvements in trailing 12-month EBITDA, we exit the fourth quarter with a net leverage ratio of around 1.7 times and gross leverage of 3.1 times, down from 3.4 and 5.5 times, respectively, in fiscal 2020. During September, Standard & Poor's upgraded our credit rating from B to B+. We view this as a recognition of our operational and financial achievements during the fiscal year and our continued efforts to strengthen our balance sheet. These improvements across the business would not have been possible without the teamwork and dedication of the entire MACOM organization. I would like to note that MACOM is a diverse business with a strong financial model and possesses many opportunities to grow and expand as we execute our strategic priorities moving into fiscal year '22 and beyond.
I will now turn the discussion back over to Steve.
Stephen G. Daly -- President and Chief Executive Officer and Director
Thank you, Jack. MACOM expects revenue in fiscal Q1 ending December 31, 2021, to be in the range of $157 million to $161 million. Adjusted gross margin is expected to be in the range of 60% to 62%, and adjusted earnings per share is expected to be between $0.60 and $0.64, based on 71.4 million fully diluted shares. In fiscal Q1, we estimate Industrial and Defense revenues to be flat, Data Center to be down 10% and Telecom to be up 15%. As I have noted, we maintain a long-term perspective on executing our strategy, and we are confident that we can continue to improve our financials and take market share in the months and years ahead. Based on the opportunities in front of us, we believe that MACOM has the potential to achieve at least 10% year-over-year revenue growth in FY '22. In addition, we believe our business model has the leverage to improve profitability. Our product portfolio is stronger than it was a year ago. And for this reason, we are confident we can meet or exceed our FY '22 targets.
I would now like to ask the operator to take any questions.

[Operator Instructions] Our first question coming from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Vivek Arya -- Bank of America -- Analyst
Thanks for taking my question. Steve, on the last call, you kind of outlined this March to $1 billion or so in terms of sales by 2025. So that implies kind of a low double-digit growth CAGR and you were above that trend line in the last fiscal year. Just curious to get your thoughts as you start the new fiscal year. You're starting Q1 at a growth rate that's below that trend line. What helps you accelerate later in the year? Just give us some puts and takes as you start the year? And what role does supply constraints kind of play as you think about the growth prospects for the coming year?
Stephen G. Daly -- President and Chief Executive Officer and Director
Sure. Thank you, Vivek. So I think our comments from the last call still stand. I think we are on a good trajectory to hit our long-term goals of $1 billion. So not much has materially changed since those comments were made three months ago. I will say that we are starting the year with almost a near-record backlog. We have been diligently working on bringing better and better products to market. So I think we're in a stronger point today than we were, say, a year ago. I also would just highlight not to look at any one particular quarter as a bellwether of sort of long-term growth because we are in dynamic markets, and we are constantly seeing some markets accelerate and others decelerate at different times. So I wouldn't read too much into any particular quarter. And I'll also just highlight that the underlying growth driver for our business is new products. And as I talked about, in my prepared remarks, we continue to increase the velocity of new products that we're bringing to market. So generally speaking, I think we're on plan. As I noted in the script also, as we look forward, we think we can achieve at least 10% year-over-year growth. This is similar to the messaging that we gave really a year ago at this time when we looked into our fiscal 2021.
Vivek Arya -- Bank of America -- Analyst
Got it. And then one more question on the supply side. Which is the bottleneck? Is it the ability to get your components out? Is it the ability of somebody else in the supply chain which is gating your growth because the customer cannot complete the bill of materials? What is the real bottleneck for you? Or is the bottleneck somebody else in the industry? And what is changing or can change to help ease those bottlenecks over the next few quarters? Thank you.
Stephen G. Daly -- President and Chief Executive Officer and Director
Thank you. So I think we see both dynamics at play. First one being our ability to, let's say, get capacity or deliver products on the required schedule. So we are constrained in certain areas there. And those areas would revolve around, in some instances, semiconductor technology or package technology. And also, in some instances, OSAT capacity, which is the assembly and test portion. So there are some constraints there. And then I would say within the last three months, we have seen some of our customers actually coming up short on components necessary for them to build their systems, and that has resulted in pushouts of schedules and whatnot. But I have to say one thing. These I view as short-term issues. These are not going to stand in the way of MACOM growing and hitting its long-term targets. We look at these issues as tactical issues that our operations team needs to manage and work with our customers. And the fact that we have such a diversified business, I think, puts us in a very enviable spot. And as I highlighted on my remarks again, the highest volume product that we sold last year was less than 2% of our total revenue. So we have a very diverse business. So while there are constraints in the industry, we are not getting too focused on that. We are focused on developing the new technologies and the products that we need to grow over the long term.

Our next question coming from the line of Quinn Bolton with Needham & Company. Your line is open.
Quinn Bolton -- Needham & Company -- Analyst
Great. Congratulations on the nice results and outlook. Steve, I wanted to ask two questions on the Data Center business. You guided it down 10%. Wondering if there's any specific factors for the weakness in the December quarter. And then a follow-on question. You mentioned the new equalization product for active copper cables. It seems like there's growing interest for active copper cables to extend reach in the Data Center. I'm just wondering if you could give us your outlook for the adoption of active cables in the Data Center and where your opportunities may lie with that product? Thank you.
Stephen G. Daly -- President and Chief Executive Officer and Director
Sure. Thank you. So -- maybe I'll make some -- a few broader comments on our business in the Data Center and then talk about some of the sub product areas that we address. So -- if we put things in perspective, I'd just highlight first that the data is one of our smallest end markets. It's the third smallest. In fiscal year 2019, we had about $114 million of revenue. In fiscal year 2020, that grew to $126 million in revenue. And then last year, it grew to $138 million in revenue. And as we look out over the next 12 months, we think that there'll be continued growth of in the range of 8% to 10%. So that will be four consecutive years of growth in the Data Center. This is also with the backdrop, as we discussed two quarters ago that some of our legacy AMCC business was tailing off, and we expected about a $15 million decline fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021. So I'll mention those points as the backdrop. As we ended the year, we actually -- our fiscal year, we had a very strong backlog. Our book-to-bill in the Data Center segment was the strongest of the three. But then when you start to look at our business in the different areas where we sell our products, we see a lot of different moving parts.
So for example, our core business of 100G CWDM4 analog solutions for optical modules has been down in the last few quarters. In fact, our lead customer, their volumes are down 30% to 40%. But what's been happening here is we've been gaining market share at other accounts, and that's been offsetting that decline. And we see that as a good thing. We see that as diversifying our overall business. So when we look out into our full fiscal year 2022, we would expect our core 100G CWDM4 business to grow. The other two areas that we're very active, of course, is active optical cables where we sell products to both 25G and 100G applications. The 25G business last year was very strong, primarily due to build out in international markets. That has slowed this year, and we think that will slow in the next few months as well. The 100G applications for active optical cables has also declined. We think that there's a lot of inventory. And we also think some of our customers are having issues getting supply of other components, and that's putting a bit of a headwind on our ability to ship to them. When we think about the areas that will be very strong over the next year, we look at 100G and 400G DR1 and DR4, as being very strong.
We're seeing tremendous growth These are PAM4 platforms. We're also seeing very strong growth with 200G PAM4 solutions as well. So that's an area of very strong growth. We're also seeing growth in the Data Center from crosspoint switches. We haven't talked about that a lot recently. And we sell into two applications in the Data Center. One is redundant switching and the other is areas that are requiring very low latency. We have fairly sophisticated 160 x 160 crosspoint switches that we sell into this market. And then as I pointed out in the script, 400 ZR applications are growing. And this is an area where -- as this market is growing, it's sort of coming to MACOM in the sense that we are a leader with modulator drivers, whether we're driving lithium niobate or indium phosphide or silicon photonic modulators, we have the industry's best drivers and best TIAs. And so as this market is beginning to develop where coherent is coming closer to the Data Center, and perhaps inside the Data Center, we think that will drive growth.
So there's a lot of moving parts within the Data Center, depending on the type of product we're selling. And then as you asked specifically about active copper cable, we are excited about the new launch of the product line. It's an area that we have core competency. I'll say that we're not quite sure how big it could be. We do know that passive cables are one of the highest volume areas within the Data Center. And so as our customers adopt active solutions, we'll have to see what the adoption rate is. I don't think anybody really knows. We'll have to wait and see. But our products, I can tell you, support 50G, 100G, 200G and 400G applications. And so we are very actively working with companies that are building copper cables that want to use our products. So there's a lot of moving parts within the data center. I haven't really spoken also about the fact that we are starting to see early traction with our laser portfolio. And so we're also excited about that.
Quinn Bolton -- Needham & Company -- Analyst
Okay. Thank you for the great color.

And our next question coming from the line of Tom O'Malley with Barclays. Your line is open.
Tom O'Malley -- Barclays -- Analyst
Good morning guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just want to hit on another one of the large segments in Telecom. You had talked about earlier this year some weakness in Fronthaul. You're obviously guiding that business up pretty strong in December. Is that a return to some growth there? And then if you could just address some of the supply issues that we're hearing on that side of the business, that would be really helpful.
Stephen G. Daly -- President and Chief Executive Officer and Director
Yes. So in terms of Telecom, there's -- also it's a very diverse end market. It's one of our -- potentially one of our most diverse and possibly fastest growing over the next three to five years. Your question about weakness in fronthaul, I would say that it's at a steady run rate at the moment, which is definitely lower than where it was 1.5 years ago. But I wouldn't necessarily categorize it as weak. I would say that -- there's a steady pull of products for 5G fronthaul but not at the rate that it was 1.5 years ago. Where we're seeing growth in telecom is certainly cable infrastructure and PON, and we think these areas will continue to grow over the next one to two years. And so -- that's an area that we're very, very focused on. The last item I'll mention just about Telecom in general is our activity on the RF side of 5G telecom infrastructure. We've been making great progress with our front-end modules and also our power amplifiers, our GaN on silicon carbide power amplifiers are starting to gain traction, and we expect growth from that product line over the next 12 months.
Tom O'Malley -- Barclays -- Analyst
That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up, we're seeing some consolidation in the optical universe this morning with Lumentum and Neo. Could you talk about -- I know it's very early here, and you guys probably just learned about it this morning as well. But could you talk about downstream impact there, obviously, you'd assume that there's some analog componentry that you're selling across multiple customers. How do you think that consolidation may impact you guys?
Stephen G. Daly -- President and Chief Executive Officer and Director
Yes. So Tom, I haven't really thought about that, and that has'nt been of focus for MACOM here in the last 24 hours. So this industry has seen consolidation, and we'll continue to see consolidation in our position in the market as a merchant supplier to companies that build RF, microwave, optical, telecom equipment. And so from our perspective, at a very high level, nothing has really changed from that merger or any other mergers that may happen in the future.

Our next question coming from the line of Harsh Kumar with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.
Harsh Kumar -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst
Hey guys. First of all, congratulations, once again, solid execution and avoiding a lot of supply issues that the industry is seeing. Steve, if I can ask you on that question, did you happen to leave any revenues behind? I know you mentioned some supply issues, but I was curious if you would characterize the amount that you might have left behind on the table?
Stephen G. Daly -- President and Chief Executive Officer and Director
Yes. I'll just make a comment and maybe ask Jack to also help answer that question. When we put forward our guidance for the next quarter, we take all things into consideration, including customer schedules, availability material. We make judgments based on turns business. And so we come up with what we consider a reasonable target for the next period. And in areas where we think there may be supply constraints, we have to factor that in and then make a judgment. So I would view all of that activity as normal business operations. And so I would -- I don't look at that -- those projections as leaving revenue on the table and that's not how we look at it. We look at it strictly how do we service the customers, what can we do in a reasonable amount of time. And we don't necessarily want to start putting a dollar value on what revenues we might have shipped in the past. But Jack, maybe you can help answer the question more completely.
John F. Kober -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yes. Thanks, Steve. Good morning, Harsh, yes, I think we performed as expected when we set our forecast, there can be a certain amount of variability with any forecast, as the quarter evolves. But it's through that interaction that we've had with our customers and to some extent with our suppliers as well that we're able to end up coming in where we did. And we just haven't put a number on the impact to any one quarter. And as Steve had mentioned earlier, it'll just become part of our day-to-day processes that we have here as opposed to onetime issue that we're dealing with.
Harsh Kumar -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst
Understood, guys. And if I can ask a two -part question here for my follow-up. So with the Data Center, the initial turn that happened in MACOM two years ago when you came on was that Data Center was going to grow and then we had a little bit of a setback for the customer, I think last quarter, a quarter ago, something like that. As you look out into the next year and you try to compare the growth of Data Center for next fiscal year versus your 10%, at least 10% target. Do you think Data Center will overgrow that 10% number and contribute to growth? Or will it be in line with the rest of the corporate number.

Please stand by while speaker line reconnected.
Stephen Ferranti -- Vice President of Investor Relation
Hello, everyone. We're back on. We apologize for that technical difficulty. We got disconnected for a brief moment. So hopefully, everybody is still there, and we'll continue with the Q&A at this moment.
Harsh Kumar -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst
Okay, Great. So let me just repeat my question. I guess the question was, do you see Data Center in this coming fiscal year to grow faster than your overall corporate at least 10% sort of outline that you gave? And then you talked about the -- to Vivek's question, you talked about a $1 billion number last quarter. I was wondering if you could help give us a little bit more color on what kind of margin structure you would expect the company to have at that sort of a run rate?
Stephen G. Daly -- President and Chief Executive Officer and Director
Sure. So the first part of your question, as we look at the three markets, we're estimating today that the Industrial and Defense and Data Center will be in the range of 8% to 10% and Telecom will be around 15% for year-over-year growth figures. So that's our best estimate today. And those are -- we're we want to caveat those comments as it's still early in the year, and a lot can happen in the next 12 months. And then your question around what our margin profile might look like as we grow in scale, we really have to wait and see on that. I mean, it's very difficult for us to make that level of a projection. I can tell you that as we're launching our products, we are focused on launching products that are having above corporate average margins so that we can drive additional profitability. When we start to bring on products like the KV CAPS, when we start to bring on our GaN on Silicon Carbide, when we start to diversify and sell products into the automotive industry, we think that we're going to have stronger positions with our customers, and they're going to be willing to pay a premium for our products. So we'd like to think that things will continue to improve, but it's very difficult for us to really quantify that specifically at this point.
Harsh Kumar -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst
Understood guys. Thank you so much and great job.

Our next question coming from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Harlan Sur -- JPMorgan -- Analyst
Good morning guys. Great job on the quarterly and fiscal year execution and strong margins. The team has had a strong execution on new product introductions across all of the end markets. It's clearly a strong indicator of the forward revenue growth potential. I believe that you guys had a target to grow new product introductions by 15% last year. How does that translate to the 130 new standard products that you talked about on the call? Did you guys hit that 15% target? And then just as importantly, what's the profile of gross margin across those new products? I would assume the majority of them are above current corporate gross margins, but wanted to get your views.
Stephen G. Daly -- President and Chief Executive Officer and Director
Sure. So we did hit our targets in terms of new product introductions last year. And as we look into fiscal year 2022, we'll be launching even more products. So we're accelerating the rate of product introduction, and it's coming across all of our different business units. And as you remember, we organize our business into technology area. So each of our six technology areas is just doing a great job, hitting their targets and they've been very focused. We don't typically break out gross margins by end market or product line or technology. So I can't really comment further on that. Recognize that we are always focused on improving profitability. But also, it's important to us to increase absorption and make sure that our fabs are full. And so we have to make sure that we balance volume with pricing at some point. But I will say we have a tremendous amount of leverage in our business model to grow without bringing on any significant incremental costs? And maybe, Jack, you can talk about that for a moment.
John F. Kober -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yes. Thanks, Steve. And we do have a variety of different gross margin profiles that some of the new product introductions that we do have that they may meet. And with the current business model that we have, where we've got certain products that are internally manufactured from a fab and also from a back-end process perspective. And then we've got other product lines and areas of the business where the fab and the back end are all outsourced. So that gives us a fair amount of leverage as we go forward where we could expand the top line without having to meaningfully impact some of the incremental costs. So we are very focused on overall on the bottom line improvements as well as these -- as the top line improvements that we might get through new product introductions. So all in all, we think we've got the fair amount of leverage within the existing model where it can continue to grow.
Harlan Sur -- JPMorgan -- Analyst
Yes. Thanks for that. And you guys already have a pretty strong position in metro and long-haul coherent optics, TIAs, drivers. So it's good to see that you guys are leveraging that on the new coherent 400 ZR DCI technology. This is a new technology that's just starting to ramp up. But I believe Microsoft is just starting to fire in the second half of this year. You've got the other cloud titans firing next year. So I guess the question for you guys is, does the team already have design wins for its modulated drivers and coherent amplifiers with the qualified 400 ZR pluggable module vendors? And do you expect these products to contribute to revenues this fiscal year?
Stephen G. Daly -- President and Chief Executive Officer and Director
So the short answer is yes, we do have customer traction, and we do expect a very modest contribution in our fiscal 2022. The big growth will come in 2023. So I think we're doing all the right things. We are known in the metro and long-haul area, as you've highlighted, to have best-in-class products. And so we're very busy right now focusing on supporting a wide range of module manufacturers that want to get into this business. It's going to break away from being a captured market to more of a merchant market for module solutions here. And we think we will have a very strong position in the next one to two years.

And the next question coming from the line of Karl Ackerman with Cowen & Company. Your line is open.
Karl Ackerman -- Cowen & Company -- Analyst
Yes. Thank you. Two questions, if I may. First, you've continued to transition the business overall to industrial and aerospace applications that tend to have product cycles longer than your average. I was hoping you could discuss some of the key drivers as you look into your fiscal 2022, such as selling more of a module and/or subsystem versus a discrete solution?
Stephen G. Daly -- President and Chief Executive Officer and Director
So the vast majority of our business is component-based business. So we -- the growth that we have this year will not be coming from modules per se. In some of our RF and microwave product lines, we do package assemblies, but we would consider those components where we might have a few active devices and substrates and it might be a connectorized box, but we don't really view that as a sub.

Stephen Ferranti -- Vice President of Investor Relation
Hello, everyone. We apologize again for the technical difficulties. We are back here, and we'll pick up where we left off on Karl's question.
Stephen G. Daly -- President and Chief Executive Officer and Director
And Karl, I'm not sure how much of that you heard, but my short answer is in the next -- in 12 months, we do not expect strong contribution from module and subsystems that's primarily a component-based business. However, we are, over the long term, going to be going after this business. We recently opened up a remote design center, which is explicitly focused on very high-frequency modules and subsystems. So it's an area of strong strategic interest.
Karl Ackerman -- Cowen & Company -- Analyst
Thank you for that, I appreciate that. For my follow-up, I want to focus on Data Center and follow up with your comments in response to Quinn's question on Data Center. Is the growth of 100 gig next year coming from outside the U.S.? And then second, as you answer that question, do you have a view of when your PAM4 solutions would reach revenue crossover versus, say, NRZ products as you gain these opportunities in 100-gig and 400-gig Tier one offerings? Thank you.
Stephen G. Daly -- President and Chief Executive Officer and Director
Yes. So a lot of the growth is coming from international markets for the 100G CWDM4. So that's absolutely correct. In terms of when there'll be that crossover that you talked about, it's very difficult for me to make an estimate there. So I really don't have a comment on that.

Our next question coming from the line of Chris Caso with Raymond James. Your line is open.
Chris Caso -- Raymond James -- Analyst
Yes. Thanks. Good morning. Just a clarification regarding some of the fiscal 2022 growth numbers that you've mentioned in response to some of the questions. It would seem if I heard you right, with the Telecom up about 15% a year and then Data Center and I&D up each about 8% to 10% year-on-year. It suggests that all of the sequential growth that you get through the year comes from Data Center, with the other segments kind of being flat on a quarterly basis. Is that interpretation correct? And maybe you could just address that what -- is there a seasonal aspect to it? Or is that just Data Center driving all the growth incrementally through the year?
Stephen G. Daly -- President and Chief Executive Officer and Director
Yes. I think that -- I think there's some truth to what you're saying, but I would say that we're not giving such specific guidance that we can comment on sequential growth. I think there's going to be periods where markets are going up and markets are going down over the course of fiscal year 2022. And we saw that even in this past quarter where Telecom was down and I&D was up and Data Center was essentially flat. So I would essentially set the expectation that you'll continue to see, on a sequential basis, a lot of variability in the growth rates. And it has to do with -- just the timing of orders, our ability to execute given supply issues and demand, which is oftentimes difficult to predict. So I wouldn't want you to draw that conclusion. Instead, I would step back and look that and understand that the three end markets should grow if not all, double digit, close to double digit with the exception of Telecom, we feel that will certainly be at a minimum double-digit growth.
Chris Caso -- Raymond James -- Analyst
Got it. Okay. As a follow-up, if you addressed some of your prior comments on pricing, and obviously, we've seen across the space that pricing is starting to go up, particularly in response to some of the input cost increases. So maybe talk about what you're doing with respect to the input cost, how that's applying to pricing? And is that a headwind or a tailwind or perhaps neutral to gross margins?
Stephen G. Daly -- President and Chief Executive Officer and Director
Sure. And I think Jack did even make mention of pricing in some of his comments regarding strategies and whatnot. So pricing is strategic in areas where we believe we have pricing strength, we try to optimize pricing. But generally speaking, we're in very competitive markets and customers really understand the value of their components. They're constantly comparing your performance against your competitors. And so I wouldn't say that there is this wholesale opportunity to increase pricing across the board in this environment. That is not our approach. We look at pricing very strategically. We try to win market share and set pricing that's compelling for customers while also optimizing profitability. When we see areas where there's cost increases, we would always try to absorb that first. And if that's not possible, then we would have to work with customers and figure out a path to potentially pass some of that cost along.

Our next question coming from the line of Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Your line is open.
Tore Svanberg -- Stifela -- Analyst
Yes. Thank you. Congratulations on the operating margin milestone. First question is -- and congratulations on getting the automotive certification. When is the earliest we can expect revenues from automotive? And you listed a few applications, was just wondering if there's one or two that you think you could get the traction in earlier?
Stephen G. Daly -- President and Chief Executive Officer and Director
Yes. So we, today, have some parts in production for automotive customers. Those are generally on the RF side of our technology. And we want to expand that into our lightwave and also capacitors and even power management. In addition, our high-performance analog is working at studying some of the new standards that are coming out for high-speed data connectivity within automobiles. So our view of this certification in our view with automotive in general is really long-term growth. We think there may be some near-term opportunities with some of our high-voltage capacitors since they are run in our fab which is automotive certified. We think that will be compelling technology for customers. We also want to try to take advantage of some of the shortages that we're seeing within the industry. And we've been actively reacting to opportunities that are coming our way across various parts of our portfolio. So it is, Tore, it's a long-term effort, and it will incrementally support our growth.
Tore Svanberg -- Stifela -- Analyst
Great. Thank you for that. And as my follow-up, could you just give us a little bit of a detailed updates on the DFB laser business, timing, ramps, so on and so forth?
Stephen G. Daly -- President and Chief Executive Officer and Director
Yes. So as everybody knows, we announced the Clear Diamond portfolio in June of 2021, and that was essentially a portfolio of 25G DFB lasers. We were initially targeting Telecom. So that would be fronthaul and midhaul type applications. So it's been about five months since we made that announcement. And I can tell you that -- we're very pleased with the results today. We see that we are gaining market share. We have numerous customers that have qualified the product. Those customers are in low rate production, and we're supporting a variety of protocols, including devices that operate at 1310 nanometer as well as BiDi modules, which is 1270 and 1330, which is typically used for international 5G as well as CWDM6, which is for China. So we're very pleased with traction. We're very pleased that we're shipping in low volume production to date.. And we think that fiscal year 2022 will be a growth year for 5G laser business for MACOM. What's really surprised us with our laser activities is the traction that we're getting from customers that are building modules for the Data Center. And we're actually seeing an equal amount of activity with CWDM4 modules, which is up to about two kilometers. And also RANW-DM4, which is up to 10 kilometers for Data Center interconnect.
Again, we have multiple customers where we're qualified and we're beginning to ship low rate volume production. And that's a bit of a surprise for us. And so it's certainly a pleasant surprise. And then the last area for the lasers that I'll just highlight is on our 25G FP lasers. We are actively working to bump out competitors' 10G DFB's with our lower cost and higher performance 25G fabric. And we think this solution lowers the overall module cost for our customers, and so it's compelling for them. So when we step back and look at our laser business, we think we're going to have very strong growth. It's going to support not only our Telecom growth this year, but also it will start to support Data Center. And again, our philosophy of having a portfolio where we have 2.5G all the way up to 50G lasers, we have DML lasers, CW lasers. We're also working on laser arrays for next-generation data center platforms. We're pleased with the results from the team, and this next 12 months will be a period where we start ramping to higher volumes.

Our next question is coming from the line of David Williams with Benchmark. Your line is open.
David Williams -- Benchmark -- Analyst
Hi. Good morning. And thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to maybe touch on the supply side. And it seems like you side set some of the Southeast Asia COVID issues that some of your peers have noted. And I think last quarter, you have noted maybe a higher risk execution in the fourth quarter. And just kind of curious how you're seeing that as we head into the first quarter here? Is that risk still there? Or do you feel like maybe some of that's abated a bit?
Stephen G. Daly -- President and Chief Executive Officer and Director
So one of the things we were concerned about last quarter was we were seeing certain countries shutting down and having factories either divide or operate at less than 100% utilization. And we've seen that situation improve dramatically. So Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, they're all starting to sort of come back to normal. And so that risk has come down dramatically.
David Williams -- Benchmark -- Analyst
Okay. Great. Thanks. And then maybe some base station deployments in China. It seems like they've been a little bit slower roll out and COVID pockets are starting to appear. Just kind of curious your thinking about the base station deployments and just generally overall, kind of the China, Mainland, how you see that performing over the next maybe 12 months?
Stephen G. Daly -- President and Chief Executive Officer and Director
So I think there's going to be steady, very moderate growth. That's our expectation. There's been a lot of tenders out earlier in the year, mostly for 700 megahertz. We have little exposure to that platform. So from our point of view, deployment in China will be very muted, I would say, based on our current outlook. And from our point of view, what's important is that we win market share when we get our newest products, including our gain on silicon carbide, massive MIMO power amplifiers designed in wherever we can, and that's the focus for the business. We are seeing also an uptick in interest with ORAN. We're seeing an increased interest from international companies outside of China that are interested in MACOM's products, not only on the RF side, but also on the optical side as well as on the PON side of Telecom networks. So while China might be a bit muted, we see other opportunities outside of China.

Our next question coming from the line of Sam Peterman with Craig-Hallum Capital. Your line is open.
Sam Peterman -- Craig-Hallum Capital -- Analyst
Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to go back to Telecom and ask about growth drivers for the next year. I think at the beginning of the call, you listed out four things, if I remember right, as growth drivers there, including PON, cable infrastructure, microwave radios and SATCOM. And I was curious if you guys could just kind of rank order those, how you think those will impact your telecom growth in F 2022? And then if you could kind of comment on how you see potential cable capex spending rollover, balance out between kind of a lot of the new initiatives for fiber and fiber-to-the-home that have been going out here in the last couple of months? Thanks.
Stephen G. Daly -- President and Chief Executive Officer and Director
Thank you. So it's very difficult for us to rank order in those end markets. I think they're going to grow at different rates at different times during the next 12 months. We think that, as I talked about at a high level, our expectation is 15% year-over-year growth for the entire segment. Certainly, 5G will contribute, no doubt. Cable infrastructure is very strong right now here in the U.S., we do expect that to continue. To your question about sort of capex spending. We think this is a multiyear cycle. This will not be a 12-month cycle. This is a three year cycle minimum. We also believe that we're winning market share in 10G PON, specifically on burst mode TIAs and drivers, where we have a very strong position and lasers. So the 10G PON market will be an area where we have very strong growth. We also, I'll just point out -- and again, this speaks to the -- our thesis that our growth is product driven. We are gaining traction with our Avalanche photodetectors inside of GPON equipment. And so that's also exciting for us. So really, as we think about Telecom, it's our core product lines getting stronger and winning market share, whether it's high-power switches, front-end modules for base stations, components for fronthaul and GPON. So a lot of moving parts. I wouldn't necessarily want to rank order any one of them as being more important than the other.
Sam Peterman -- Craig-Hallum Capital -- Analyst
Got it. Okay. Thanks for all the color there. And then just a quick follow-up on capex. It looks like a pretty big step up to -- from $20 million-ish in the last two years to over $35 million this next year. You said it was mostly around production capacity in your fabs. Is this kind of ramping for certain products, maybe within auto or elsewhere? Or could you just give any color on kind of what that capex spend is going for?
Stephen G. Daly -- President and Chief Executive Officer and Director
Yes. Maybe I'll say a few words and then Jack can follow up. So if we go back to 2019, we effectively shutoffs capex spending to do a thorough top-to-bottom review of current assets. And so then we -- after that reset in the middle of our fiscal 2019 we began to open it up. And our goal for the first two years was to have more depreciation roll off than we rolled on with new capex spending, and we were able to do that very successfully for, let's say, year one and year two. But that did create a bit of a pent-up demand for capex spending. And so what you're seeing this year is us increasing capital in the range of $10 million. But if you look at the three year average, we've actually -- our depreciation in capex is almost a wash in terms of increasing our overall depreciation. And that's -- we're happy. When we think about where that -- where those dollars are going, we're spending about $8 million a year on general refresh expansion, new equipment upgrades within our fab here in Massachusetts. And then the balance of that spending goes across the business units for test and measurement equipment or other general uses to support growth. So there's no -- not any one program driving the capex increase. We think it's continued investment in the business. It's true we are developing new technologies like our 0.14 GaN on Silicon Carbide but the capital expenditure on that program is actually quite modest. It's not a big driver of our overall spending. And Jack, I don't know whether you want to add some color to that?
John F. Kober -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yes. And Sam, I think the number we put out there was some capex to be in the range of $30 million to $35 million. So not over the $35 million number that I think you had mentioned. And we are looking at each of our capex investments very closely to make sure we have the appropriate returns. there are certain infrastructure items that we do believe will support the business and some of the new products that we are introducing over time. And there's a combination of manufacturing capabilities as part of that capex number, but there's also some capital equipment that is working its way into our R&D investments as well, once again, supporting some of the new product introductions that we have.

Our last question is coming from the line of Harsh Kumar with Piper Sandler.Your line is open.
Harsh Kumar -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst
Sorry. Hi guys. I wanted to go back to Chris Caso's question earlier that related to the Data Center cadence for call it, 8% to 10% growth. Would -- if I understood it correctly, I think your starting point is down 10% sequentially into the December quarter. So you start the year down. And to get to 10%, we have to basically plug in kind of double-digit sequential growth numbers for all practical purposes to get to that 8% to 10% cadence. Is that feasible? And if so, Steve, could you maybe elaborate? I know you talked a lot about Data Center business, but what would be the one or two things that would drive it?
Stephen G. Daly -- President and Chief Executive Officer and Director
So one of the things we've seen with our Data Center business is impact from back-end supply and packaging. So if we were to look at all of our end markets and pick one that has the most impact, it would certainly be the Data Center. We use very high-density traits that are used in some of our packages and we're having issues associated with supply on those technologies. So that's causing the revenue to be, I'll say, back-end loaded for this fiscal year, and it's primarily driven by supply. So we think that will open up toward the back half. And as a result, that will -- that's why we're starting the year, let's say, at a low point, but we do think there will be strong sequential growth after that with ending the year in a very strong position. But supply definitely has a play here.
Harsh Kumar -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst

Welcome to MACOM's Fourth Fiscal Quarter 2021 Conference Call. This call is being recorded today, Thursday, November 4, 2021. [Operator Instructions]
I will now turn the call to Mr. Steve Ferranti, MACOM's Vice President of Strategic Initiatives and Investor Relations. Mr. Ferranti, please go ahead.
Stephen Ferranti -- Vice President of Investor Relation
Thank you, Olivia. Good morning, and welcome to our call to discuss MACOM's Fourth Fiscal Quarter and Fiscal Year 2021 Financial Results. I would like to remind everyone that our discussion today will contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to certain risks and uncertainties as defined in the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today. For a more detailed discussion of the risks and uncertainties that could result in those differences, we refer you to MACOM's filings with the SEC. Management's statements during this call will also include discussion of certain adjusted non-GAAP financial information. A reconciliation of GAAP to adjusted non-GAAP results are provided in the company's press release and related Form 8-K, which was filed with the SEC today.
With that, I'll turn over the call to Steve Daly, President and CEO of MACOM.
Stephen G. Daly -- President and Chief Executive Officer and Director
Thank you, Steve, and good morning. I will begin today's call with a general company update. After that, Jack Kober, our Chief Financial Officer, will provide a more in-depth review of our fourth quarter and full year results for fiscal 2021. When Jack is finished, I will provide revenue and earnings guidance for the first fiscal quarter of 2022, and then we will be happy to take some questions. Our fourth fiscal quarter financial results represent continued improvements in overall performance. Revenue for Q4 was $155.2 million and adjusted EPS was $0.61 per diluted share. Notably, we exceeded 30% adjusted operating margin, which is an important milestone for the MACOM team. With another quarter of strong cash flow, we ended our fiscal year with $345 million in cash and short-term investments on our balance sheet. For the full fiscal year ending October 1, 2021, revenue was $607 million, and adjusted EPS was $2.15 per diluted share. We are pleased to report 14.5% year-over-year revenue growth and 126% year-over-year earnings growth. Our financial results this year would not have been possible without the hard work and dedication of all our employees.
In spite of certain supply chain challenges and COVID-19 headwinds, we met our internal corporate goals, our new product development schedules and our revenue and earnings targets. I would like to thank the entire team for their extraordinary efforts and commitment. MACOM is fortunate to have such a hard-working and dedicated management team and employees. Our Q4 and full year book-to-bill ratio was 1.2:1 and our turns business was approximately 13% of total revenue. We believe that the strong Q4 bookings reflect market share gains, a few large long-term IND orders, which we'll ship over multiple quarters, as well as orders being placed by customers one or two quarters ahead of required ship dates due to longer than normal manufacturing cycle times. Our strong bookings over the course of FY '21 allows us to start FY '22 with a higher-than-typical backlog. We continue to manage various supply related interruptions and challenges due to COVID-19 and production capacity limitations with certain semiconductor, package and substrate technologies.
Our operations, planning and logistics teams have done an excellent job managing through these industry dynamics, and they are working around the clock to meet customer commitments. Fiscal Q4 revenue by end market was generally as expected, with Industrial & Defense at $75.1 million, Telecom at $46.6 million and Data Center at $33.5 million. I&D was up 5% sequentially, Telecom was down 3% sequentially and Data Center was up around 1% sequentially. For fiscal year 2021, I&D was up 44%, Data Center up 10% and Telecom down 10%. In FY '21, our top 10 end customers represented 26.5% of our total revenue, and our revenue concentration on any one product was less than 1.6% of our total revenue. We maintain a diversified technology portfolio as well as a very diversified customer base with thousands of customers. Our Industrial & Defense end market performed well during fiscal Q4 and for the 2021 fiscal year. Our success in this end market is the result of the efforts that we began in 2019 within our engineering groups to revitalize our portfolio of RF and microwave products, including increasing the of base of new product introduction, expanding to fill in the gaps of our product lines, developing new innovative technologies and reengaging major customers with a more focused sales and marketing effort.
More recently, we also began ramping up efforts to cross-sell our optical and high-performance analog products to Industrial & Defense customers, which creates a sizable growth opportunity for us. Overall, I am pleased with the level of engagement our sales and business development teams have had at major defense OEMs over the last few quarters, involving a variety of ground, airborne, ship-based programs, including radar, electronic warfare, avionics and RF and optical communication applications. These programs are typically long life cycle programs, and we expect they will contribute to our growth in FY '22 and beyond. Our Telecom end market revenue was slightly down in Q4 primarily due to softness in the 5G market, which was offset by strong demand in broadband access and DOCSIS 3.1 cable TV infrastructure markets. MACOM has a broad CATV product portfolio, including single lended and differential amplifiers, transformers, power dividers, combiners, couplers and Dyflex filters. 5G represents a large growth opportunity for MACOM as worldwide demand for improved connectivity at higher data rates grows.
In addition, we see growth opportunities in PON, CATV infrastructure, microwave radios and SATCOM during FY '22, primarily driven by strong end market dynamics, new product introductions and market share gains. Our Data Center end market revenue was essentially flat in Q4. Nevertheless, we believe Data Center remains a large growth opportunity for MACOM. We expect new product introductions will be the primary driver for growth for us in this market. Some examples include 25G DFB lasers and 50G CW lasers, photodetectors, laser drivers and transimpedance amplifiers. I'll note that earlier this week, we announced a new linear equalizer product line, which will support high data rate applications, including active copper cables used inside the Data Center. We believe our strategy to collaborate with leading DSP chip suppliers allows MACOM to stay focused on designing and producing the industry's next-generation high-speed TIAs and laser drivers. I'll note with the ramp-up of 400G ZR and Data Center interconnects, we are seeing an increased interest in the development of coherent solutions for next-generation 800G and higher data rates for connections, both between and within Data Centers.
Coherent ZR technology typically utilizes silicon photonic optics, along with a coherent DSP to transmit a QAM modulated optical signal on a single wavelength. MACOM is a leading merchant supplier of modulator drivers and linear TIAs for coherent modules, and we are currently in volume production with 32 gigabaud, 64 gigabaud and 96 gigabaud product families. We are also beginning to see the proliferation of coherent optics into the access market with low-cost tunable 100G solutions. As a merchant supplier, we are working with our module customers in the Data Center and enterprise markets to support their development of coherent optics with our existing product portfolio and are developing new products as the requirements for higher bandwidth continues to emerge across all market segments. We had many technical accomplishments in fiscal 2021, and I would like to highlight a few. First, we internally documented 43 new invention disclosures, we formally submitted 49 new patent applications to the U.S. patent office, and we were awarded 44 new patents.
Innovation and invention is critical to our future success and I would like to congratulate our engineering community for their excellent work in this area. Second, during the year, we introduced over 130 standard products, and we expect to grow product introductions in FY '22 by an additional 35%. In addition, we had great success with our custom IC development activities, which complements the build-out of our standard product portfolio. During the year, we supported approximately 20 customer-funded major IC developments and many smaller unfunded projects. Further, I am pleased to provide a progress report on four important strategic technology developments. First, our 0.14 GaN on Silicon Carbide process transfer from AFRL is on plan, and our fab and device engineering teams have done remarkable work over the past 12 months. To date, we have verified the processes' small signal performance. And more importantly, we have measured over 4.5 watts per millimeter at 25 volts at expand frequencies. We believe this power density performance is extremely competitive. In the coming months, we will be optimizing the process with a goal to achieve even higher power level.
I'll note, we have recently designed a MMIC power amplifier and processed it on both the AFRL and MACOM process. And with the exception of power levels, we have almost identical performance. During FY '22, we plan to complete the installation of new backside process equipment as well as installing atomic layer deposition or ALD capability for device passivation. We recognize we have a lot of work ahead. However, our engineering results to date are compelling, and we believe in time, we will capture market share in the high-frequency GaN MMIC market. Second, we are making excellent progress on our silicon photonics product development. As I reported last quarter, we are now working with our fab partner on producibility and yields. Third, our pure carbide high-power GaN amplifier product line continues to expand since its introduction over one year ago.
Notably, we recently released three additional high-power products including a 60-watt narrowband C-band product for RADAR and two general purpose, 15-watt broadband products operating at DC to 12 gigahertz and 30 megahertz to 3.5 gigahertz. And last, as a reminder, our 1,000 volt chip capacitor product line or KV CAPS, is fully production released, and we are beginning to take orders and gain traction in the market. KV CAPS are ideal for high-voltage applications where small size and reliability is critical. As we look ahead to fiscal year 2022, our priorities include: further accelerating and streamlining our new product development process, gaining market share by staying focused on addressing customer needs and providing continuous engineering support, strengthening our competitive advantage by introducing new products based on MACOM's proprietary semiconductor processes, increasing our direct business with major OEMs and further optimizing the efficiency of our operations to improve profitability and cash flow.
Our organization is lean and can move quickly to ensure we capture market share. We believe that making modest internal investments in our business can provide opportunities to achieve higher-than-average return on invested capital. And therefore, supports our goal of establishing best-in-class profitability. The risk-to-reward ratios on these internal investments can be compelling since they leverage existing assets that we already have in place. For example, we are investing in our Massachusetts and Michigan wafer fabs to modernize, develop new process technologies, improve quality and expand capacity. We believe investments in new and existing process technologies like 0.14 and 90-nanometer GaN on silicon carbide, or high-voltage capacitors, will enable differentiation across our RF and optical products, which ultimately supports our goals of very profitable growth. Related to our wafer fab investment, we are pleased to announce that our low wafer fab recently achieved IATF16949 certification for automotive quality management systems.
As a reminder, this certification focuses on defect prevention, waste reduction and supply chain management for the international automotive industry. We believe this certification will help to open new doors for us in the automotive industry. In particular, we believe our lightwave, RF and microwave, KV capacitor and high-speed analog technologies are ideal for automotive applications such as sensors, LiDAR, under-the-hood power management and autonomous driving applications. In addition to investing in our fab facilities, we're also expanding our assembly, new product prototyping and engineering test capabilities at some of our other facilities. For example, we anticipate that our Nashua, New Hampshire facility will expand its manufacturing operations space by 100% over the next 12 months. This facility supports a wide range of commercial and defense-related product development and production programs. In addition, we just opened a new state-of-the-art product engineering and application lab at our Newport Beach, California facility. All of these activities require strong and expanding workforces, and we have not been standing still in hiring. We are focused on expanding R&D with best-in-class talent. And as an example, in fiscal year '21, we hired over a dozen PhDs to join our already strong workforce.
In summary, MACOM has a wide range of products in production today, spanning dozens of different product lines, serving thousands of customers. Many of these products have long life cycles and produced revenue for years after they've been introduced. We view this diversity of technology, products and end market applications as an inherent strength of the company, helping to provide a broad revenue base.
Jack will now provide a more detailed review of our financial results.
John F. Kober -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. We continued the trend of improving profitability during the fourth fiscal quarter ended October 1, 2021. Revenue, gross margin, operating margin and earnings per share all showed improvement on a sequential and year-over-year basis. Adjusted operating margin exceeded 30%, which is a notable milestone for the company. Revenue for the fourth quarter was $155.2 million, up 1.7% quarter-over-quarter. As expected, the sequential improvement in revenue was driven primarily by an increase in Industrial & Defense. Data Center was up modestly, partially offset by a modest decline in Telecom end markets. For the full fiscal year, revenue was $607 million in fiscal 2021, up 14.5% from $530 million in fiscal 2020. On a geographic basis, domestic customers represented approximately 46% of both our fiscal Q4 and fiscal year 2021 results. These amounts represent increases from the approximate 36% and 41% of sales to domestic customers in fiscal Q4 2020 and fiscal year 2020, respectively.
Adjusted gross profit in fiscal Q4 was $94.9 million or 61.1% of revenue, up another 80 basis points sequentially. Adjusted gross margin for the full fiscal year 2021 was 59.6%, up 460 basis points from 55% in fiscal 2020. The strong gross margin performance for fiscal year 2021 was the result of a variety of ongoing initiatives that we've touched on in the past. We have numerous internal actions focused on improving the efficiency of our operations, including optimizing yields, reducing scrap, cycle time enhancements and supply chain management. We have also been focused on pricing across our pipeline and customer base. We believe all of these efforts will support our gross margins to continue to be above 60% and over time, further contribute to additional gains in gross margins. Total adjusted operating expense was $48.1 million, consisting of R&D expense of $30.2 million and SG&A expense of $17.9 million. Total operating expenses were sequentially flat from fiscal Q3 levels. For fiscal year 2021, total adjusted operating expense was $191.2 million, down 2.4% from fiscal year 2020 levels. For fiscal year 2022, we believe that -- operating expenses will increase as we expand sales and marketing activities and enhance our R&D capabilities by investing in new programs to support our future growth while also continuing to be very disciplined with our discretionary spending. Adjusted operating income in fiscal Q4 was $46.8 million, up from $43.9 million in fiscal Q3.
Adjusted operating margin was 30.2% for fiscal Q4, sequentially up from 28.7% in Q3. Adjusted operating margin in excess of 30% represents a new record for MACOM since we went public back in 2012. For fiscal year 2021, adjusted operating income was $170.3 million compared to $96 million for fiscal 2020, representing 77% year-over-year increase. Depreciation expense for fiscal Q4 was $5.7 million and adjusted EBITDA was $52.5 million. For fiscal year 2021, our last 12 months adjusted EBITDA was $194 million as compared to $124.5 million in fiscal 2020, representing a 56% increase year-over-year. Adjusted net interest expense for fiscal Q4 was $1.4 million, sequentially flat from fiscal Q3. Fiscal year 2021 adjusted net interest expense was $11 million, down from $23.3 million in 2020, primarily due to the restructuring of debt in March of 2021. Our adjusted income tax rate in fiscal Q4 remained at 5% and resulted in an expense of approximately $2.3 million. Our cash tax payments were $200,000 for the fourth quarter and $1.6 million for fiscal year 2021. We expect our adjusted income tax rate to remain at 5% for fiscal 2022.
Fiscal Q4 adjusted net income was $43.3 million compared to $40.3 million in fiscal Q3. Adjusted earnings fully diluted share was $0.61, utilizing a share count of 71.1 million shares compared to $0.57 of adjusted earnings per share in fiscal Q3. For fiscal year 2021, adjusted net income was $151.9 million, more than double fiscal year 2020 income of $67.1 million. Fiscal year adjusted EPS was $2.15 compared to $0.98 in fiscal year 2020. Now moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow items. Our Q4 accounts receivable balance was $84.6 million, up from $71.6 million in fiscal Q3. As a result, days sales outstanding were 49 days. Our accounts receivable balance reflects an increase over prior periods as our revenue has been increasing and also due to more shipments occurring later in the quarter as compared to prior quarters. Inventories $82.7 million at quarter end, down a little less than $1 million sequentially. Inventory turns were flat sequentially at 2.9 times during the fourth fiscal quarter. Our fiscal Q4 cash flow from operations of approximately $40.8 million was down $4.1 million sequentially, primarily due to the increase in accounts receivable balances.
Capital expenditures totaled $5 million in fiscal Q4. Fiscal 2021 capex of $18 million was up slightly from $17.6 million in fiscal 2020, primarily attributable to investments in our fabs as well as R&D infrastructure. We expect capex to increase in fiscal year '22 and be in the range of $30 million to $35 million as we continue to invest in our internal fab and production capabilities as well as R&D equivalent. Free cash flow was $35.8 million for the fourth fiscal quarter and $130.5 million for fiscal 2021. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments for the fourth fiscal quarter were $345 million, up $36 million from fiscal Q3 and up by $11.8 million versus the same quarter in the prior year. As a reminder, in March 2021, we repaid $100 million of our outstanding term loans and also entered into a $450 million convertible note arrangement, utilizing the proceeds to further pay down our outstanding term loans. Our long-term debt currently consists of $450 million of convertible notes due in 2026 and $121 million remaining on our term loans due in 2024. Neither of these arrangements require any principal repayments until the maturity.
We also have $29 million of finance leases. With the improvements in trailing 12-month EBITDA, we exit the fourth quarter with a net leverage ratio of around 1.7 times and gross leverage of 3.1 times, down from 3.4 and 5.5 times, respectively, in fiscal 2020. During September, Standard & Poor's upgraded our credit rating from B to B+. We view this as a recognition of our operational and financial achievements during the fiscal year and our continued efforts to strengthen our balance sheet. These improvements across the business would not have been possible without the teamwork and dedication of the entire MACOM organization. I would like to note that MACOM is a diverse business with a strong financial model and possesses many opportunities to grow and expand as we execute our strategic priorities moving into fiscal year '22 and beyond.
I will now turn the discussion back over to Steve.
Stephen G. Daly -- President and Chief Executive Officer and Director
Thank you, Jack. MACOM expects revenue in fiscal Q1 ending December 31, 2021, to be in the range of $157 million to $161 million. Adjusted gross margin is expected to be in the range of 60% to 62%, and adjusted earnings per share is expected to be between $0.60 and $0.64, based on 71.4 million fully diluted shares. In fiscal Q1, we estimate Industrial and Defense revenues to be flat, Data Center to be down 10% and Telecom to be up 15%. As I have noted, we maintain a long-term perspective on executing our strategy, and we are confident that we can continue to improve our financials and take market share in the months and years ahead. Based on the opportunities in front of us, we believe that MACOM has the potential to achieve at least 10% year-over-year revenue growth in FY '22. In addition, we believe our business model has the leverage to improve profitability. Our product portfolio is stronger than it was a year ago. And for this reason, we are confident we can meet or exceed our FY '22 targets.
I would now like to ask the operator to take any questions.
Questions and Answers:

[Operator Instructions] Our first question coming from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Vivek Arya -- Bank of America -- Analyst
Thanks for taking my question. Steve, on the last call, you kind of outlined this March to $1 billion or so in terms of sales by 2025. So that implies kind of a low double-digit growth CAGR and you were above that trend line in the last fiscal year. Just curious to get your thoughts as you start the new fiscal year. You're starting Q1 at a growth rate that's below that trend line. What helps you accelerate later in the year? Just give us some puts and takes as you start the year? And what role does supply constraints kind of play as you think about the growth prospects for the coming year?
Stephen G. Daly -- President and Chief Executive Officer and Director
Sure. Thank you, Vivek. So I think our comments from the last call still stand. I think we are on a good trajectory to hit our long-term goals of $1 billion. So not much has materially changed since those comments were made three months ago. I will say that we are starting the year with almost a near-record backlog. We have been diligently working on bringing better and better products to market. So I think we're in a stronger point today than we were, say, a year ago. I also would just highlight not to look at any one particular quarter as a bellwether of sort of long-term growth because we are in dynamic markets, and we are constantly seeing some markets accelerate and others decelerate at different times. So I wouldn't read too much into any particular quarter. And I'll also just highlight that the underlying growth driver for our business is new products. And as I talked about, in my prepared remarks, we continue to increase the velocity of new products that we're bringing to market. So generally speaking, I think we're on plan. As I noted in the script also, as we look forward, we think we can achieve at least 10% year-over-year growth. This is similar to the messaging that we gave really a year ago at this time when we looked into our fiscal 2021.
Vivek Arya -- Bank of America -- Analyst
Got it. And then one more question on the supply side. Which is the bottleneck? Is it the ability to get your components out? Is it the ability of somebody else in the supply chain which is gating your growth because the customer cannot complete the bill of materials? What is the real bottleneck for you? Or is the bottleneck somebody else in the industry? And what is changing or can change to help ease those bottlenecks over the next few quarters? Thank you.
Stephen G. Daly -- President and Chief Executive Officer and Director
Thank you. So I think we see both dynamics at play. First one being our ability to, let's say, get capacity or deliver products on the required schedule. So we are constrained in certain areas there. And those areas would revolve around, in some instances, semiconductor technology or package technology. And also, in some instances, OSAT capacity, which is the assembly and test portion. So there are some constraints there. And then I would say within the last three months, we have seen some of our customers actually coming up short on components necessary for them to build their systems, and that has resulted in pushouts of schedules and whatnot. But I have to say one thing. These I view as short-term issues. These are not going to stand in the way of MACOM growing and hitting its long-term targets. We look at these issues as tactical issues that our operations team needs to manage and work with our customers. And the fact that we have such a diversified business, I think, puts us in a very enviable spot. And as I highlighted on my remarks again, the highest volume product that we sold last year was less than 2% of our total revenue. So we have a very diverse business. So while there are constraints in the industry, we are not getting too focused on that. We are focused on developing the new technologies and the products that we need to grow over the long term.
Stephen Ferranti -- Vice President of Investor Relation

Operator
Our next question coming from the line of Quinn Bolton with Needham & Company. Your line is open.
Quinn Bolton -- Needham & Company -- Analyst
Great. Congratulations on the nice results and outlook. Steve, I wanted to ask two questions on the Data Center business. You guided it down 10%. Wondering if there's any specific factors for the weakness in the December quarter. And then a follow-on question. You mentioned the new equalization product for active copper cables. It seems like there's growing interest for active copper cables to extend reach in the Data Center. I'm just wondering if you could give us your outlook for the adoption of active cables in the Data Center and where your opportunities may lie with that product? Thank you.
Stephen G. Daly -- President and Chief Executive Officer and Director
Sure. Thank you. So -- maybe I'll make some -- a few broader comments on our business in the Data Center and then talk about some of the sub product areas that we address. So -- if we put things in perspective, I'd just highlight first that the data is one of our smallest end markets. It's the third smallest. In fiscal year 2019, we had about $114 million of revenue. In fiscal year 2020, that grew to $126 million in revenue. And then last year, it grew to $138 million in revenue. And as we look out over the next 12 months, we think that there'll be continued growth of in the range of 8% to 10%. So that will be four consecutive years of growth in the Data Center. This is also with the backdrop, as we discussed two quarters ago that some of our legacy AMCC business was tailing off, and we expected about a $15 million decline fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021. So I'll mention those points as the backdrop. As we ended the year, we actually -- our fiscal year, we had a very strong backlog. Our book-to-bill in the Data Center segment was the strongest of the three. But then when you start to look at our business in the different areas where we sell our products, we see a lot of different moving parts.
So for example, our core business of 100G CWDM4 analog solutions for optical modules has been down in the last few quarters. In fact, our lead customer, their volumes are down 30% to 40%. But what's been happening here is we've been gaining market share at other accounts, and that's been offsetting that decline. And we see that as a good thing. We see that as diversifying our overall business. So when we look out into our full fiscal year 2022, we would expect our core 100G CWDM4 business to grow. The other two areas that we're very active, of course, is active optical cables where we sell products to both 25G and 100G applications. The 25G business last year was very strong, primarily due to build out in international markets. That has slowed this year, and we think that will slow in the next few months as well. The 100G applications for active optical cables has also declined. We think that there's a lot of inventory. And we also think some of our customers are having issues getting supply of other components, and that's putting a bit of a headwind on our ability to ship to them. When we think about the areas that will be very strong over the next year, we look at 100G and 400G DR1 and DR4, as being very strong.
We're seeing tremendous growth These are PAM4 platforms. We're also seeing very strong growth with 200G PAM4 solutions as well. So that's an area of very strong growth. We're also seeing growth in the Data Center from crosspoint switches. We haven't talked about that a lot recently. And we sell into two applications in the Data Center. One is redundant switching and the other is areas that are requiring very low latency. We have fairly sophisticated 160 x 160 crosspoint switches that we sell into this market. And then as I pointed out in the script, 400 ZR applications are growing. And this is an area where -- as this market is growing, it's sort of coming to MACOM in the sense that we are a leader with modulator drivers, whether we're driving lithium niobate or indium phosphide or silicon photonic modulators, we have the industry's best drivers and best TIAs. And so as this market is beginning to develop where coherent is coming closer to the Data Center, and perhaps inside the Data Center, we think that will drive growth.
So there's a lot of moving parts within the Data Center, depending on the type of product we're selling. And then as you asked specifically about active copper cable, we are excited about the new launch of the product line. It's an area that we have core competency. I'll say that we're not quite sure how big it could be. We do know that passive cables are one of the highest volume areas within the Data Center. And so as our customers adopt active solutions, we'll have to see what the adoption rate is. I don't think anybody really knows. We'll have to wait and see. But our products, I can tell you, support 50G, 100G, 200G and 400G applications. And so we are very actively working with companies that are building copper cables that want to use our products. So there's a lot of moving parts within the data center. I haven't really spoken also about the fact that we are starting to see early traction with our laser portfolio. And so we're also excited about that.
Quinn Bolton -- Needham & Company -- Analyst
Okay. Thank you for the great color.

And our next question coming from the line of Tom O'Malley with Barclays. Your line is open.
Tom O'Malley -- Barclays -- Analyst
Good morning guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just want to hit on another one of the large segments in Telecom. You had talked about earlier this year some weakness in Fronthaul. You're obviously guiding that business up pretty strong in December. Is that a return to some growth there? And then if you could just address some of the supply issues that we're hearing on that side of the business, that would be really helpful.
Stephen G. Daly -- President and Chief Executive Officer and Director
Yes. So in terms of Telecom, there's -- also it's a very diverse end market. It's one of our -- potentially one of our most diverse and possibly fastest growing over the next three to five years. Your question about weakness in fronthaul, I would say that it's at a steady run rate at the moment, which is definitely lower than where it was 1.5 years ago. But I wouldn't necessarily categorize it as weak. I would say that -- there's a steady pull of products for 5G fronthaul but not at the rate that it was 1.5 years ago. Where we're seeing growth in telecom is certainly cable infrastructure and PON, and we think these areas will continue to grow over the next one to two years. And so -- that's an area that we're very, very focused on. The last item I'll mention just about Telecom in general is our activity on the RF side of 5G telecom infrastructure. We've been making great progress with our front-end modules and also our power amplifiers, our GaN on silicon carbide power amplifiers are starting to gain traction, and we expect growth from that product line over the next 12 months.
Tom O'Malley -- Barclays -- Analyst
That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up, we're seeing some consolidation in the optical universe this morning with Lumentum and Neo. Could you talk about -- I know it's very early here, and you guys probably just learned about it this morning as well. But could you talk about downstream impact there, obviously, you'd assume that there's some analog componentry that you're selling across multiple customers. How do you think that consolidation may impact you guys?
Stephen G. Daly -- President and Chief Executive Officer and Director
Yes. So Tom, I haven't really thought about that, and that has'nt been of focus for MACOM here in the last 24 hours. So this industry has seen consolidation, and we'll continue to see consolidation in our position in the market as a merchant supplier to companies that build RF, microwave, optical, telecom equipment. And so from our perspective, at a very high level, nothing has really changed from that merger or any other mergers that may happen in the future.

Our next question coming from the line of Harsh Kumar with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.
Harsh Kumar -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst
Hey guys. First of all, congratulations, once again, solid execution and avoiding a lot of supply issues that the industry is seeing. Steve, if I can ask you on that question, did you happen to leave any revenues behind? I know you mentioned some supply issues, but I was curious if you would characterize the amount that you might have left behind on the table?
Stephen G. Daly -- President and Chief Executive Officer and Director
Yes. I'll just make a comment and maybe ask Jack to also help answer that question. When we put forward our guidance for the next quarter, we take all things into consideration, including customer schedules, availability material. We make judgments based on turns business. And so we come up with what we consider a reasonable target for the next period. And in areas where we think there may be supply constraints, we have to factor that in and then make a judgment. So I would view all of that activity as normal business operations. And so I would -- I don't look at that -- those projections as leaving revenue on the table and that's not how we look at it. We look at it strictly how do we service the customers, what can we do in a reasonable amount of time. And we don't necessarily want to start putting a dollar value on what revenues we might have shipped in the past. But Jack, maybe you can help answer the question more completely.
John F. Kober -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yes. Thanks, Steve. Good morning, Harsh, yes, I think we performed as expected when we set our forecast, there can be a certain amount of variability with any forecast, as the quarter evolves. But it's through that interaction that we've had with our customers and to some extent with our suppliers as well that we're able to end up coming in where we did. And we just haven't put a number on the impact to any one quarter. And as Steve had mentioned earlier, it'll just become part of our day-to-day processes that we have here as opposed to onetime issue that we're dealing with.
Harsh Kumar -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst
Understood, guys. And if I can ask a two -part question here for my follow-up. So with the Data Center, the initial turn that happened in MACOM two years ago when you came on was that Data Center was going to grow and then we had a little bit of a setback for the customer, I think last quarter, a quarter ago, something like that. As you look out into the next year and you try to compare the growth of Data Center for next fiscal year versus your 10%, at least 10% target. Do you think Data Center will overgrow that 10% number and contribute to growth? Or will it be in line with the rest of the corporate number.
[Technical Issues]
Operator
Please stand by while speaker line reconnected.
Stephen Ferranti -- Vice President of Investor Relation
Hello, everyone. We're back on. We apologize for that technical difficulty. We got disconnected for a brief moment. So hopefully, everybody is still there, and we'll continue with the Q&A at this moment.
Harsh Kumar -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst
Okay, Great. So let me just repeat my question. I guess the question was, do you see Data Center in this coming fiscal year to grow faster than your overall corporate at least 10% sort of outline that you gave? And then you talked about the -- to Vivek's question, you talked about a $1 billion number last quarter. I was wondering if you could help give us a little bit more color on what kind of margin structure you would expect the company to have at that sort of a run rate?
Stephen G. Daly -- President and Chief Executive Officer and Director
Sure. So the first part of your question, as we look at the three markets, we're estimating today that the Industrial and Defense and Data Center will be in the range of 8% to 10% and Telecom will be around 15% for year-over-year growth figures. So that's our best estimate today. And those are -- we're we want to caveat those comments as it's still early in the year, and a lot can happen in the next 12 months. And then your question around what our margin profile might look like as we grow in scale, we really have to wait and see on that. I mean, it's very difficult for us to make that level of a projection. I can tell you that as we're launching our products, we are focused on launching products that are having above corporate average margins so that we can drive additional profitability. When we start to bring on products like the KV CAPS, when we start to bring on our GaN on Silicon Carbide, when we start to diversify and sell products into the automotive industry, we think that we're going to have stronger positions with our customers, and they're going to be willing to pay a premium for our products. So we'd like to think that things will continue to improve, but it's very difficult for us to really quantify that specifically at this point.
Harsh Kumar -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst
Understood guys. Thank you so much and great job.

Our next question coming from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Harlan Sur -- JPMorgan -- Analyst
Good morning guys. Great job on the quarterly and fiscal year execution and strong margins. The team has had a strong execution on new product introductions across all of the end markets. It's clearly a strong indicator of the forward revenue growth potential. I believe that you guys had a target to grow new product introductions by 15% last year. How does that translate to the 130 new standard products that you talked about on the call? Did you guys hit that 15% target? And then just as importantly, what's the profile of gross margin across those new products? I would assume the majority of them are above current corporate gross margins, but wanted to get your views.
Stephen G. Daly -- President and Chief Executive Officer and Director
Sure. So we did hit our targets in terms of new product introductions last year. And as we look into fiscal year 2022, we'll be launching even more products. So we're accelerating the rate of product introduction, and it's coming across all of our different business units. And as you remember, we organize our business into technology area. So each of our six technology areas is just doing a great job, hitting their targets and they've been very focused. We don't typically break out gross margins by end market or product line or technology. So I can't really comment further on that. Recognize that we are always focused on improving profitability. But also, it's important to us to increase absorption and make sure that our fabs are full. And so we have to make sure that we balance volume with pricing at some point. But I will say we have a tremendous amount of leverage in our business model to grow without bringing on any significant incremental costs? And maybe, Jack, you can talk about that for a moment.
John F. Kober -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yes. Thanks, Steve. And we do have a variety of different gross margin profiles that some of the new product introductions that we do have that they may meet. And with the current business model that we have, where we've got certain products that are internally manufactured from a fab and also from a back-end process perspective. And then we've got other product lines and areas of the business where the fab and the back end are all outsourced. So that gives us a fair amount of leverage as we go forward where we could expand the top line without having to meaningfully impact some of the incremental costs. So we are very focused on overall on the bottom line improvements as well as these -- as the top line improvements that we might get through new product introductions. So all in all, we think we've got the fair amount of leverage within the existing model where it can continue to grow.
Harlan Sur -- JPMorgan -- Analyst
Yes. Thanks for that. And you guys already have a pretty strong position in metro and long-haul coherent optics, TIAs, drivers. So it's good to see that you guys are leveraging that on the new coherent 400 ZR DCI technology. This is a new technology that's just starting to ramp up. But I believe Microsoft is just starting to fire in the second half of this year. You've got the other cloud titans firing next year. So I guess the question for you guys is, does the team already have design wins for its modulated drivers and coherent amplifiers with the qualified 400 ZR pluggable module vendors? And do you expect these products to contribute to revenues this fiscal year?
Stephen G. Daly -- President and Chief Executive Officer and Director
So the short answer is yes, we do have customer traction, and we do expect a very modest contribution in our fiscal 2022. The big growth will come in 2023. So I think we're doing all the right things. We are known in the metro and long-haul area, as you've highlighted, to have best-in-class products. And so we're very busy right now focusing on supporting a wide range of module manufacturers that want to get into this business. It's going to break away from being a captured market to more of a merchant market for module solutions here. And we think we will have a very strong position in the next one to two years.

And the next question coming from the line of Karl Ackerman with Cowen & Company. Your line is open.
Karl Ackerman -- Cowen & Company -- Analyst
Yes. Thank you. Two questions, if I may. First, you've continued to transition the business overall to industrial and aerospace applications that tend to have product cycles longer than your average. I was hoping you could discuss some of the key drivers as you look into your fiscal 2022, such as selling more of a module and/or subsystem versus a discrete solution?
Stephen G. Daly -- President and Chief Executive Officer and Director
So the vast majority of our business is component-based business. So we -- the growth that we have this year will not be coming from modules per se. In some of our RF and microwave product lines, we do package assemblies, but we would consider those components where we might have a few active devices and substrates and it might be a connectorized box, but we don't really view that as a sub.
[Technical Issues]
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, please stand by.
Stephen Ferranti -- Vice President of Investor Relation
Hello, everyone. We apologize again for the technical difficulties. We are back here, and we'll pick up where we left off on Karl's question.
Stephen G. Daly -- President and Chief Executive Officer and Director
And Karl, I'm not sure how much of that you heard, but my short answer is in the next -- in 12 months, we do not expect strong contribution from module and subsystems that's primarily a component-based business. However, we are, over the long term, going to be going after this business. We recently opened up a remote design center, which is explicitly focused on very high-frequency modules and subsystems. So it's an area of strong strategic interest.
Karl Ackerman -- Cowen & Company -- Analyst
Thank you for that, I appreciate that. For my follow-up, I want to focus on Data Center and follow up with your comments in response to Quinn's question on Data Center. Is the growth of 100 gig next year coming from outside the U.S.? And then second, as you answer that question, do you have a view of when your PAM4 solutions would reach revenue crossover versus, say, NRZ products as you gain these opportunities in 100-gig and 400-gig Tier one offerings? Thank you.
Stephen G. Daly -- President and Chief Executive Officer and Director
Yes. So a lot of the growth is coming from international markets for the 100G CWDM4. So that's absolutely correct. In terms of when there'll be that crossover that you talked about, it's very difficult for me to make an estimate there. So I really don't have a comment on that.
Operator
Our next question coming from the line of Chris Caso with Raymond James. Your line is open.
Chris Caso -- Raymond James -- Analyst
Yes. Thanks. Good morning. Just a clarification regarding some of the fiscal 2022 growth numbers that you've mentioned in response to some of the questions. It would seem if I heard you right, with the Telecom up about 15% a year and then Data Center and I&D up each about 8% to 10% year-on-year. It suggests that all of the sequential growth that you get through the year comes from Data Center, with the other segments kind of being flat on a quarterly basis. Is that interpretation correct? And maybe you could just address that what -- is there a seasonal aspect to it? Or is that just Data Center driving all the growth incrementally through the year?
Stephen G. Daly -- President and Chief Executive Officer and Director
Yes. I think that -- I think there's some truth to what you're saying, but I would say that we're not giving such specific guidance that we can comment on sequential growth. I think there's going to be periods where markets are going up and markets are going down over the course of fiscal year 2022. And we saw that even in this past quarter where Telecom was down and I&D was up and Data Center was essentially flat. So I would essentially set the expectation that you'll continue to see, on a sequential basis, a lot of variability in the growth rates. And it has to do with -- just the timing of orders, our ability to execute given supply issues and demand, which is oftentimes difficult to predict. So I wouldn't want you to draw that conclusion. Instead, I would step back and look that and understand that the three end markets should grow if not all, double digit, close to double digit with the exception of Telecom, we feel that will certainly be at a minimum double-digit growth.
Chris Caso -- Raymond James -- Analyst
Got it. Okay. As a follow-up, if you addressed some of your prior comments on pricing, and obviously, we've seen across the space that pricing is starting to go up, particularly in response to some of the input cost increases. So maybe talk about what you're doing with respect to the input cost, how that's applying to pricing? And is that a headwind or a tailwind or perhaps neutral to gross margins?
Stephen G. Daly -- President and Chief Executive Officer and Director
Sure. And I think Jack did even make mention of pricing in some of his comments regarding strategies and whatnot. So pricing is strategic in areas where we believe we have pricing strength, we try to optimize pricing. But generally speaking, we're in very competitive markets and customers really understand the value of their components. They're constantly comparing your performance against your competitors. And so I wouldn't say that there is this wholesale opportunity to increase pricing across the board in this environment. That is not our approach. We look at pricing very strategically. We try to win market share and set pricing that's compelling for customers while also optimizing profitability. When we see areas where there's cost increases, we would always try to absorb that first. And if that's not possible, then we would have to work with customers and figure out a path to potentially pass some of that cost along.

Our next question coming from the line of Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Your line is open.
Tore Svanberg -- Stifela -- Analyst
Yes. Thank you. Congratulations on the operating margin milestone. First question is -- and congratulations on getting the automotive certification. When is the earliest we can expect revenues from automotive? And you listed a few applications, was just wondering if there's one or two that you think you could get the traction in earlier?
Stephen G. Daly -- President and Chief Executive Officer and Director
Yes. So we, today, have some parts in production for automotive customers. Those are generally on the RF side of our technology. And we want to expand that into our lightwave and also capacitors and even power management. In addition, our high-performance analog is working at studying some of the new standards that are coming out for high-speed data connectivity within automobiles. So our view of this certification in our view with automotive in general is really long-term growth. We think there may be some near-term opportunities with some of our high-voltage capacitors since they are run in our fab which is automotive certified. We think that will be compelling technology for customers. We also want to try to take advantage of some of the shortages that we're seeing within the industry. And we've been actively reacting to opportunities that are coming our way across various parts of our portfolio. So it is, Tore, it's a long-term effort, and it will incrementally support our growth.
Tore Svanberg -- Stifela -- Analyst
Great. Thank you for that. And as my follow-up, could you just give us a little bit of a detailed updates on the DFB laser business, timing, ramps, so on and so forth?
Stephen G. Daly -- President and Chief Executive Officer and Director
Yes. So as everybody knows, we announced the Clear Diamond portfolio in June of 2021, and that was essentially a portfolio of 25G DFB lasers. We were initially targeting Telecom. So that would be fronthaul and midhaul type applications. So it's been about five months since we made that announcement. And I can tell you that -- we're very pleased with the results today. We see that we are gaining market share. We have numerous customers that have qualified the product. Those customers are in low rate production, and we're supporting a variety of protocols, including devices that operate at 1310 nanometer as well as BiDi modules, which is 1270 and 1330, which is typically used for international 5G as well as CWDM6, which is for China. So we're very pleased with traction. We're very pleased that we're shipping in low volume production to date.. And we think that fiscal year 2022 will be a growth year for 5G laser business for MACOM. What's really surprised us with our laser activities is the traction that we're getting from customers that are building modules for the Data Center. And we're actually seeing an equal amount of activity with CWDM4 modules, which is up to about two kilometers. And also RANW-DM4, which is up to 10 kilometers for Data Center interconnect.
Again, we have multiple customers where we're qualified and we're beginning to ship low rate volume production. And that's a bit of a surprise for us. And so it's certainly a pleasant surprise. And then the last area for the lasers that I'll just highlight is on our 25G FP lasers. We are actively working to bump out competitors' 10G DFB's with our lower cost and higher performance 25G fabric. And we think this solution lowers the overall module cost for our customers, and so it's compelling for them. So when we step back and look at our laser business, we think we're going to have very strong growth. It's going to support not only our Telecom growth this year, but also it will start to support Data Center. And again, our philosophy of having a portfolio where we have 2.5G all the way up to 50G lasers, we have DML lasers, CW lasers. We're also working on laser arrays for next-generation data center platforms. We're pleased with the results from the team, and this next 12 months will be a period where we start ramping to higher volumes.

Our next question is coming from the line of David Williams with Benchmark. Your line is open.
David Williams -- Benchmark -- Analyst
Hi. Good morning. And thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to maybe touch on the supply side. And it seems like you side set some of the Southeast Asia COVID issues that some of your peers have noted. And I think last quarter, you have noted maybe a higher risk execution in the fourth quarter. And just kind of curious how you're seeing that as we head into the first quarter here? Is that risk still there? Or do you feel like maybe some of that's abated a bit?
Stephen G. Daly -- President and Chief Executive Officer and Director
So one of the things we were concerned about last quarter was we were seeing certain countries shutting down and having factories either divide or operate at less than 100% utilization. And we've seen that situation improve dramatically. So Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, they're all starting to sort of come back to normal. And so that risk has come down dramatically.
David Williams -- Benchmark -- Analyst
Okay. Great. Thanks. And then maybe some base station deployments in China. It seems like they've been a little bit slower roll out and COVID pockets are starting to appear. Just kind of curious your thinking about the base station deployments and just generally overall, kind of the China, Mainland, how you see that performing over the next maybe 12 months?
Stephen G. Daly -- President and Chief Executive Officer and Director
So I think there's going to be steady, very moderate growth. That's our expectation. There's been a lot of tenders out earlier in the year, mostly for 700 megahertz. We have little exposure to that platform. So from our point of view, deployment in China will be very muted, I would say, based on our current outlook. And from our point of view, what's important is that we win market share when we get our newest products, including our gain on silicon carbide, massive MIMO power amplifiers designed in wherever we can, and that's the focus for the business. We are seeing also an uptick in interest with ORAN. We're seeing an increased interest from international companies outside of China that are interested in MACOM's products, not only on the RF side, but also on the optical side as well as on the PON side of Telecom networks. So while China might be a bit muted, we see other opportunities outside of China.

Our next question coming from the line of Sam Peterman with Craig-Hallum Capital. Your line is open.
Sam Peterman -- Craig-Hallum Capital -- Analyst
Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to go back to Telecom and ask about growth drivers for the next year. I think at the beginning of the call, you listed out four things, if I remember right, as growth drivers there, including PON, cable infrastructure, microwave radios and SATCOM. And I was curious if you guys could just kind of rank order those, how you think those will impact your telecom growth in F 2022? And then if you could kind of comment on how you see potential cable capex spending rollover, balance out between kind of a lot of the new initiatives for fiber and fiber-to-the-home that have been going out here in the last couple of months? Thanks.
Stephen G. Daly -- President and Chief Executive Officer and Director
Thank you. So it's very difficult for us to rank order in those end markets. I think they're going to grow at different rates at different times during the next 12 months. We think that, as I talked about at a high level, our expectation is 15% year-over-year growth for the entire segment. Certainly, 5G will contribute, no doubt. Cable infrastructure is very strong right now here in the U.S., we do expect that to continue. To your question about sort of capex spending. We think this is a multiyear cycle. This will not be a 12-month cycle. This is a three year cycle minimum. We also believe that we're winning market share in 10G PON, specifically on burst mode TIAs and drivers, where we have a very strong position and lasers. So the 10G PON market will be an area where we have very strong growth. We also, I'll just point out -- and again, this speaks to the -- our thesis that our growth is product driven. We are gaining traction with our Avalanche photodetectors inside of GPON equipment. And so that's also exciting for us. So really, as we think about Telecom, it's our core product lines getting stronger and winning market share, whether it's high-power switches, front-end modules for base stations, components for fronthaul and GPON. So a lot of moving parts. I wouldn't necessarily want to rank order any one of them as being more important than the other.
Sam Peterman -- Craig-Hallum Capital -- Analyst
Got it. Okay. Thanks for all the color there. And then just a quick follow-up on capex. It looks like a pretty big step up to -- from $20 million-ish in the last two years to over $35 million this next year. You said it was mostly around production capacity in your fabs. Is this kind of ramping for certain products, maybe within auto or elsewhere? Or could you just give any color on kind of what that capex spend is going for?
Stephen G. Daly -- President and Chief Executive Officer and Director
Yes. Maybe I'll say a few words and then Jack can follow up. So if we go back to 2019, we effectively shutoffs capex spending to do a thorough top-to-bottom review of current assets. And so then we -- after that reset in the middle of our fiscal 2019 we began to open it up. And our goal for the first two years was to have more depreciation roll off than we rolled on with new capex spending, and we were able to do that very successfully for, let's say, year one and year two. But that did create a bit of a pent-up demand for capex spending. And so what you're seeing this year is us increasing capital in the range of $10 million. But if you look at the three year average, we've actually -- our depreciation in capex is almost a wash in terms of increasing our overall depreciation. And that's -- we're happy. When we think about where that -- where those dollars are going, we're spending about $8 million a year on general refresh expansion, new equipment upgrades within our fab here in Massachusetts. And then the balance of that spending goes across the business units for test and measurement equipment or other general uses to support growth. So there's no -- not any one program driving the capex increase. We think it's continued investment in the business. It's true we are developing new technologies like our 0.14 GaN on Silicon Carbide but the capital expenditure on that program is actually quite modest. It's not a big driver of our overall spending. And Jack, I don't know whether you want to add some color to that?
John F. Kober -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yes. And Sam, I think the number we put out there was some capex to be in the range of $30 million to $35 million. So not over the $35 million number that I think you had mentioned. And we are looking at each of our capex investments very closely to make sure we have the appropriate returns. there are certain infrastructure items that we do believe will support the business and some of the new products that we are introducing over time. And there's a combination of manufacturing capabilities as part of that capex number, but there's also some capital equipment that is working its way into our R&D investments as well, once again, supporting some of the new product introductions that we have.

Our last question is coming from the line of Harsh Kumar with Piper Sandler.Your line is open.
Harsh Kumar -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst
Sorry. Hi guys. I wanted to go back to Chris Caso's question earlier that related to the Data Center cadence for call it, 8% to 10% growth. Would -- if I understood it correctly, I think your starting point is down 10% sequentially into the December quarter. So you start the year down. And to get to 10%, we have to basically plug in kind of double-digit sequential growth numbers for all practical purposes to get to that 8% to 10% cadence. Is that feasible? And if so, Steve, could you maybe elaborate? I know you talked a lot about Data Center business, but what would be the one or two things that would drive it?
Stephen G. Daly -- President and Chief Executive Officer and Director
So one of the things we've seen with our Data Center business is impact from back-end supply and packaging. So if we were to look at all of our end markets and pick one that has the most impact, it would certainly be the Data Center. We use very high-density traits that are used in some of our packages and we're having issues associated with supply on those technologies. So that's causing the revenue to be, I'll say, back-end loaded for this fiscal year, and it's primarily driven by supply. So we think that will open up toward the back half. And as a result, that will -- that's why we're starting the year, let's say, at a low point, but we do think there will be strong sequential growth after that with ending the year in a very strong position. But supply definitely has a play here.
Harsh Kumar -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst

Non-GAAP financials are not a substitute for, nor are they superior to financials prepared in accordance with GAAP.
A detailed reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to our GAAP results is included in today's documents. I remind you that during this call, we'll make certain forward-looking statements. These include, but are not limited to, statements regarding geopolitical and macroeconomic trends, expectations for our revenue, our market trends, and our expected financial performance, including our guidance. In addition, we'll discuss our progress on integration, including our delivery of the projected synergies.
All forward-looking statements are based on today's expectations, forecasts, and assumptions. They involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our comments today. Our comments should be viewed in the context of the risk factors detailed in our most recent Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. Coherent assumes no obligation to update the information discussed during the call, except as required by law.
With that, let me turn it over to Dr. Chuck Mattera. Chuck? 
Chuck Mattera -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Mary Jane. Thank you all for joining us today. Coherent Corp. posted a record revenue quarter of 1.37 billion, consistent with the midpoint of our guidance, and grew 70% year over year and 2% sequentially.
Looking close up at legacy II-VI. Impressively, organic growth was 23% year over year and 4% sequentially, while the consolidated pro forma growth was 15% year over year. Regarding the composition of our sales by the four major markets: industrial accounted for 33%, communications 44%, 15% from electronics, and 9% from instrumentation. Turning to the distribution of our revenues by region.
The second quarter was similar to the first quarter. North America accounted for 55%; Europe, 18%; Korea and Japan combined were 13%; China was 11%; and 3% to the rest of the world. Our non-GAAP EPS was $0.95. We continued our disciplined approach to capital allocation during the quarter.
We generated 220 million in cash from operations and invested 106 million in capital equipment for 114 million in free cash flow. We also paid off 133 million of the debt. Our investments in our silicon carbide platform were nearly half of our total capital investment as we execute our multiyear road map for the electrification of transportation and renewable energy infrastructure among our commitments to sustainability. Last week, during Photonics West, we had a strong showing of our broad portfolio of new products and technology innovations that are enabling a wide range of applications across our four end markets.
Our thought leaders presented at various events, workshops, and technical sessions, and we had several significant new product announcements. These included the introduction of Python, our next-generation OLED-annealing solid-state laser targeted at new Gen 8 OLED fabs. This is the culmination of four years of innovation and development that retained Coherent's position as the annealing process of record while improving performance and significantly reducing cost per panel. We believe our innovations in this system will drive adoption into more price-sensitive displays, such as tablets, laptops, and high-end monitors.
To further secure our position as an industry leader in ultrafast cutting of OLED panels, we introduced two new ultrafast lasers. We also introduced our next-generation pump laser diodes for fiber lasers with the first semiconductor chip in the industry, to our knowledge, to achieve 50 watts of output power. And we showcased our fully automated contactless laser system for texturing and marketing implantable medical devices. Turning now to our performance by market.
Our revenue in electronics grew 131% year over year and 11% sequentially, setting another record by hitting the $200 million quarterly mark. Growth was driven primarily from sensing and the seasonal tailwinds of a new product cycle, which we described on our last call. This is the second of the seasonally high two quarters, and in the second half of the fiscal year, we will enter the seasonally low period, during which we expect to have considerably lower revenue when compared to the first half. Our customer intimacy in this market gives us optimism that the future opportunity in consumer electronics is still much broader than just VCSELs for 3D sensing.
We believe that sensing will become ubiquitous in metaverse hardware and wearables and LiDAR and other emerging applications. Our strategic engagements are growing across them all. For our silicon carbide power electronics and wireless semiconductor business, we continue to invest in silicon carbide substrate and epitaxial capacity to accelerate the pace of our shipments as demand continues to exceed our ability to supply. In the electric vehicle market, EVs represented 10% of all vehicles sold globally in calendar year 2022.
As EVs continue to grow, industry estimates expect the adoption of silicon carbide electronics will also grow but at twice the rate of the overall EV market. We are steadily gaining share in what we believe will be an underserved market for many years to come, perhaps even through the end of this decade. Communications revenue grew 18% year over year and 3% sequentially, led by both telecom and datacom, each of which achieved record revenue. Telecom growth was led by broadband initiatives, which in turn drove demand in the metro edge to access networks.
We are encouraged by the opportunity that we expect to result from the U.S.' planned $65 billion investment in broadband access from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. We expect that it will be a major catalyst for optical communications and specifically our telecom business at all levels of the value chain. As access networks grow, they drive upgrades in the metro, long-haul and submarine networks, all requiring our Coherent transceivers and ROADM integrated product solutions. Our datacom business also hit a quarterly record.
Our industry-leading position in 200G and above remains strong at 51% of our datacom transceiver business, compared to 33% a year ago. Our leadership in this area stems in part from our vertical integration of our high-speed lasers, optics, and electronics in our transceiver modules. In addition to our growth of 200G, 400G datacom transceivers, we continue to see accelerated deployments of 800G transceivers, enabling open AI and machine learning applications. We are ramping our full capacity to meet the growing customer demand over the next few quarters.
Our optical communications business was honored yesterday ahead of the Optical Fiber Conference in March with awards for three of our products that the 2023 Lightwave Innovation Review singled out. First, our 100G ZR QSFP28, which will enable service providers to upgrade millions of 10G Ethernet links to 100G at the optical network edge; second, our 200G indium phosphide electroabsorption-modulated laser, which is critical for next-generation data center interconnects; and third, our Wavemaker 4000 programmable optical spectrum synthesizer. These awards showcase our innovation leadership across our broad optical communications portfolio. Revenue into the industrial market was mixed.
EUV grew 38% year over year. Also, we achieved record revenues from products related to precision manufacturing of electric vehicle batteries. In flat panel displays, one less large Excimer line beam system shipment accounted for almost all of the quarterly change in the laser segment revenues. We saw sequential declines in the advanced packaging and interconnect markets, such as printed circuit board via hole drilling and back-end semiconductor applications such as marking.
This was offset, however, by strength in the semiconductor front end where we set another quarterly record for shipments of lasers for wafer inspection, as well as wafer annealing for logic devices. We also delivered the first full laser and optics subsystem to an industry leader for an exciting new memory application, which had previously been a nonlaser-based solution. We had a record quarter for our advanced materials and metal matrix composites into the front end of the semicap equipment market. These novel materials allow customers to push the performance limits of their wafer fab equipment, including for immersion and EUV lithography and for wafer stages and wafer chucks.
We've worked hard throughout the last few years to scale our capacity and our output to allow our customers to mitigate the semiconductor shortages by increasing tool capacity. So, we were delighted to be recognized by Applied Materials, the world's leader in wafer fab equipment, with their Supplier Excellence Award for a collaboration. We also had record Excimer laser revenues for a pulse laser deposition equipment, a rapidly growing product line serving the semicap equipment market. Customers are leveraging this new enabling technology for diverse applications from high-temperature superconducting tape for next-generation fusion reactors to 5G filters in mobile phones.
We are a market leader and a pioneer in pulse laser deposition. This technology has the promise of enabling the production of novel semiconductor materials through the engineering of atoms and photons, a great example of the synergistic power of our combinations. Our instrumentation business sustained record levels, growing 2% sequentially. While PCR-based COVID testing is tapering off, our growth in bioinstrumentation from other applications allowed this market to maintain the higher level of revenue achieved during the growth for PCR testing.
We also had strong revenue for our products in advanced imaging applications for neuroscience and disease studies. These applications require ultra-short pulsed lasers, part of our portfolio where we excel. Before I turn it over to Mary Jane, I imagine that you all have now seen our other exciting news today: our move to list our stock on the New York Stock Exchange on February 23rd. Nasdaq has served us well since our IPO on October 2nd, 1987, and we are very appreciative of that support.
With our recent growth, our continuing aspirations to be the best at what we do and our global platform, we believe that the New York Stock Exchange complements our new Coherent brand and is the right place for us to be at this time alongside many of the world's most prestigious companies. With that, I'll turn it over to Mary Jane. Mary Jane?
Mary Jane Raymond -- Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, Chuck. Our revenue of $1.37 billion was negatively affected by 6 million from currency compared to Q1 FY '23 with immaterial effects on the EPS. Our backlog was 2.9 billion at 12/31 and remains solid as customers return to more normal patterns of ordering and inventory management. Our Q2 non-GAAP gross margin was 39.8%, and the non-GAAP operating margin was 20.3%, both negatively affected by $3 million in currency or 20 basis points compared to Q1. Supply chain costs were $10 million and are not excluded to arrive at the non-GAAP results.
At the segment level, the non-GAAP operating margins were 19.4% for networking and 26.2% for materials and 15.7% for lasers. GAAP operating expenses, SG&A plus R&D, were $403 million in Q2. Excluding $90 million of amortization, 29 million of stock comp, and $16 million of transaction and integration costs, non-GAAP opex was $268 million, or 19.6% of revenue. Our total stock comp is expected to be 30 million to 32 million per quarter for each of Q3 and Q4.
Synergies have now reached $30 million on an annualized basis, and we are making good progress in all categories. Quarterly GAAP EPS was a loss of $0.58, and non-GAAP EPS was $0.95 with after tax non-GAAP adjustments of $217 million in total. The diluted share count for the GAAP results was 139 million shares. And for the non-GAAP results, the share count was 150 million shares.
The GAAP and non-GAAP EPS calculations are on Tables 6 and 7 of our press release. Interest expense in the quarter was $71 million and for the six months ended December 31st, interest expense was 132 million. Our original outlook for interest cost in August was $274 million on the basis of the one-month LIBOR reaching 4.2%. It is now forecast on the yield curve to achieve 5.1%.
Should that happen on the schedule expected, our goal, along with our debt repayments, will be to limit the change in our initial estimate to $5 million to $7 million for a total of $279 million to $281 million. Our December 31st balance of cash items was $913 million, an increase from the prior quarter of 15 million. After paying down 133 million of debt in Q2, our total debt position on December 31st was 4.6 billion. Using the trailing 12 months of adjusted EBITDA on a pro forma basis for the combined company at December 31, the gross leverage was 3.6 times, and the net leverage was 2.9 times without the synergy credit.
Including the synergy credit of 235 million that is allowed by our credit facility definition, the gross leverage is 3 times and the net leverage is 2.4 times. Note that 15 million of synergies are already in the results. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 32%. The non-GAAP tax rate is 19%.
We expect the tax rate for the remainder of fiscal year '23 to be between 18% and 22%, assuming the current mix of earnings, and no adoption of new or additional tax rulings. Returning to -- turning to the outlook for Q3 fiscal year '23. Our outlook for revenue for the third fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2023, is expected to be $1.32 billion to $1.37 billion and earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis to be $0.75 to $0.90 per share. With respect to our expectations on full-year revenue, we expect revenue to range from $5.35 billion to $5.55 billion.
Our non-GAAP EPS estimate assumes the effects of purchase accounting, which are all still preliminary, will be added back to GAAP EPS other than the depreciation that is about $5 million in Q3. The share count is 152 million shares for the entire guidance range. The EPS calculation, including the dividend treatment, is detailed on Table 8 of the press release for the guidance range. This table also shows the earnings at which the Series B preferred stock is dilutive.
All of the foregoing is at today's exchange rates at an estimated tax rate of 19%. For the non-GAAP earnings per share, we add back to the GAAP earnings pre-tax amounts of $140 million to $145 million, consisting of 95 million in amortization, 30 million in stock compensation, and 15 million to 20 million for transaction integration and restructuring. The actual dollar amount of non-GAAP items, the tax rate, the exchange rates, the purchase price accounting, and the share counts are all subject to change. As a reminder, our answers today during the Q&A may contain forecasts from which our actual results may differ for a variety of factors.
These include changes in the mix, customer requirements, supply chain availability, competition, and economic conditions. With that, Kevin, you may open the line for questions.
Questions & Answers:

[Operator instructions] We will pause for a moment while we can pull our Q&A roster. First question comes from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Your line is open.
Ananda Baruah -- Loop Capital Markets -- Analyst
Yeah. Good morning, guys. Yeah. Congrats on solid results and ongoing strong execution.
Thanks for taking the questions. Two quick ones if I could. Chuck, are you seeing any, I guess, what you would consider to be meaningful softening in any of the businesses -- in any of the meaningful businesses? And then could you give us an update on supply constraints? And then I have a quick follow-up. Thanks.
Chuck Mattera -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
OK. Well, Ananda, thanks for your question. Let's take the supply chain first. In the second quarter, the supply chain constraints affected us to a level of $67 million.
And so, that will give you some sense. It's considerably lower than it was a couple of quarters ago. It's definitely getting better, but it did have an impact on us. That's first.
Second, I tried to give you the color -- all the color we could about the markets, about the regions, about the products in our prepared comments. And I would say from the last 90 days, if you look at our revenue guidance, the only thing that you can see which is different is that we have a greater confidence on picking up the bottom end of that revenue guidance, and we shaved just a little bit off the top end. And all of that takes into account our best judgments today. And wherever there are small pockets or pockets of slowdown, we have the versatility, the resiliency, the backlog, and the determination to blow past them.
OK?
Ananda Baruah -- Loop Capital Markets -- Analyst
That's very helpful. And as a follow-up, would just love to get a sense where you guys believe legacy Coherent is in the display business cycle. And that's it for me. Thanks.
Chuck Mattera -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
OK. I'll ask Mark to take that one.
Mark Sobey -- President, Laser Segment
Hi. Thanks for the question. I think as we discussed in our prior call in November, the Excimer annealing business, represents between 20% and 25% of our quarterly revenue, and we're still very much in that phase. So, I think the forward-looking growth opportunity that we see in IT displays, specifically tablets and laptops, is in front of us, probably one to two years out.
But we're in a pretty steady phase.
Ananda Baruah -- Loop Capital Markets -- Analyst
Very helpful. Thanks a lot, guys.

One moment for our next question. Next question comes from Simon Leopold of Raymond James. Your line is open.
Simon Leopold -- Raymond James -- Analyst
Thank you very much for taking the question. I appreciate the details today. I wanted to see if we could dig into your updates on your exposure to the hyperscalers or webscalers. I'm estimating that they're probably close to 10% of total revenue, maybe a little bit below that, following the integration with the old Coherent.
But given some of the capital spending trends, I'm wondering if you can update us on your thoughts of how much of your business is coming from there and what your expectations are for the balance of calendar '23. Thank you.
Chuck Mattera -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Simon. I'm going to ask Giovanni to address your question. Thanks for your question.
Giovanni Barbarossa -- Chief Strategy Officer and President, Materials Segment
Thanks, Chuck, and thanks, Simon, for the question. So the -- of course, it does change the percentage of the exposure to hyperscalers quarter-by-quarter. But roughly right, it's about 30% of the total. We said this in the past, it's about, let's say, 30% hyperscalers, 30% what we call cloud, about maybe a group of 30 customers.
And then a long tail does the rest, the rest of the 30%. So, we have not really seen any slowdown whatsoever in the -- at least for the second half of the year. We don't really see any slowdown in demand. That could be explained by a number of factors.
I probably -- one is the fact that the higher-speed products, let's say, 200G and above, now almost they represents 50% of our total. OK? So, that's where most of the investments are growing. Particularly, of course, with the hyperscalers, we tend to innovate and introduce higher data rates and obviously the general cloud or even the long term of the customers. So, that's one reason.
The other one, as I said earlier in previous quarters, we see still an opportunity to regain share that we think the -- we lost over the past, let's say, 3 years between the transition from Finisar to II-VI and now Coherent. So, we -- there's still pockets of markets we think we can to continue to grow our share. So, the two combined explains why we don't see any slowdown. If anything, we're very -- we're quite bullish about the near-term future.
Simon Leopold -- Raymond James -- Analyst
And just a quick clarification, that 30% value you referenced is 30% of your networking segment?
Giovanni Barbarossa -- Chief Strategy Officer and President, Materials Segment
No. 30% of the datacom.
Simon Leopold -- Raymond James -- Analyst
30% of datacom. And what's that as a percent of networking?
Giovanni Barbarossa -- Chief Strategy Officer and President, Materials Segment
OK. So, that's 30% of 50%. So, it will be like 15%.
Simon Leopold -- Raymond James -- Analyst
Thank you very much. Appreciate it.

Our next question comes from James Ricchiuti with Needham. Your line is open.
Jim Ricchiuti -- Needham and Company -- Analyst
Just wanted to talk a little bit more about the laser business in that we saw a step down in laser operating margins. I was hoping you can give a little bit more color around what's contributed to that.
Chuck Mattera -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Mary Jane, do you want to take it first?
Mary Jane Raymond -- Chief Financial Officer
Sure. Generally speaking, what affects any of our segments on the margin is that -- we -- I would say that that is probably a little bit more pronounced in the laser segment, but it's generally true across all the segments.
Jim Ricchiuti -- Needham and Company -- Analyst
And the line being that you alluded to that contributed to some of the mixed results in industrial, is that a case where that ELA tool is slipping a quarter, or is that potentially going out a little further? And maybe what contributed to that? Is that just customer site not being ready, or is there some change in potentially seeing some signs of changing demand in the display market near term?
Mark Sobey -- President, Laser Segment
Jim, this is Mark. That's a good question. It wasn't actually -- it wasn't a pushout. We knew we were anticipating to ship one large landing system last [Inaudible] during the quarter.
So, there was no -- it was really based on customer demand, and so no change there. We had anticipated being able to offset with some other upside business, but as you heard, we still had some supply chain balances that affected some of our other business.
Jim Ricchiuti -- Needham and Company -- Analyst
Got it. Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from Dave Kang with B. Riley. Your line is open.
Dave Kang -- B. Riley Financial -- Analyst
Thank you. Good morning. Just wanted to clarify about your comment -- Giovanni, your comments about telecom versus datacom. So, it's 50-50 between telecom and datacom, is that what you said about Simon's question?
Giovanni Barbarossa -- Chief Strategy Officer and President, Materials Segment
Yes. I'd say it's about -- to be accurate, it's 54-46. So, 54% telecom, 46% telecom.
Dave Kang -- B. Riley Financial -- Analyst
OK. Got it. And then my question is on the backlog. So, it was down a little bit from $3.05 billion to $2.9 billion.
Just wondering if sort of backlog apparently peaked already. If you can talk about the expected decay rate, when does it normalize? And also, can you provide the composition of the backlog?
Mary Jane Raymond -- Chief Financial Officer
So, we don't normally give the composition of the backlog, number one. But two, Dave, you may remember on the last call as well as in various conferences, one of the things that I noted was that investors should not be worried if the backlog starts to go down, we don't necessarily consider it a decay because the goal was to start to ship what's in that backlog. So, we are seeing customers returning to more normal patterns of ordering, and that's exactly the behavior we saw in the second quarter was exactly what we expected.
Chuck Mattera -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
And I would add, Mary Jane -- I would add, Dave, I think that asset to normal ordering patterns will take place over the next few quarters.
Dave Kang -- B. Riley Financial -- Analyst
Got it. And my follow-up is, Chuck, your commentary about deceleration in some of the -- your end markets. Just wondering if you can specify which end markets are decelerating or expected to decelerate.
Chuck Mattera -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Dave. I would point to the industrial section in my comments about the back end of the line for the semiconductor equipment. Like that gave you some sense for a little bit of a slowdown as it relates to lasers for via-hole drilling and for marking. And I also balance that with the really substantial growth that we've seen both in EUV, on the industrial side and battery welding on the industrial side.
And then, also, in our materials for front end of the line equipment in semicap. So, it's a mix, and I said so, that's probably the best example.
Dave Kang -- B. Riley Financial -- Analyst
So, just to be clear, you're not throwing in the sensing segment as part of the segment that is slowing?
Chuck Mattera -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
I also -- in my commentary, Dave, I also pointed to the fact that in the first two quarters of our fiscal year, we have seasonal tailwinds. And I also made a clear remark about the second half of the year that we expect to be considerably lower than the first half. OK?
Dave Kang -- B. Riley Financial -- Analyst
But just because of the seasonality, not necessarily the weaker demand, right?
Chuck Mattera -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Giovanni, do you want to elaborate on that?
Giovanni Barbarossa -- Chief Strategy Officer and President, Materials Segment
Yes. Sure, Chuck. Dave, of course, the demand is not something that we have seen slowing down. There's -- that's why we talk about seasonality.
Seasonality, it's all about introduction of new products from our customers, and we follow the pattern. So, it's completely unrelated to demand.
Dave Kang -- B. Riley Financial -- Analyst
Got it. Thank you.

Our next question comes from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Samik Chatterjee -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst
Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I have a couple. Maybe if I can start with a question on backlog.
And totally understand your sort of view in terms of the backlog will start to moderate a bit as supply improves and order patterns normalize. How are you thinking about backlog related to sort of exiting the year? Does this remain elevated? And just trying to match that up against sort of the decision to take some of the high end of the revenue guide a touch lower. I mean, how does that sort of match up with the backlog still remaining quite high at this point? And I have a follow-up.
Mary Jane Raymond -- Chief Financial Officer
First of all, I'd say --
Chuck Mattera -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Mary Jane?
Mary Jane Raymond -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. Sure, Chuck. Thanks. I would say that, on the one hand, while not necessarily, I know we only have a half to go here forecasting the backlog.
Last quarter, I had indicated if we saw a resting backlog over time, not necessarily by 6/30 but over time, coming down more toward 2.5, 2.6, I wouldn't be surprised. But I don't necessarily think it will be at that level by 6/30. So, that's the first thing. I would say they're probably, really in some ways, unrelated to each other.
We just -- the backlog does remain very high. But do keep in mind that, that backlog is over 12 months. And as we've indicated in the past, typically, the individual items that are in the backlog are timed. They may not necessarily all be times to being shipped by 6/30.
So, we have some customers who routinely will give us relatively long-dated orders going across the entire 12 months. So, it really has nothing so much to do with the backlog coming down a little bit, the change in the top end. It's just more truing up the forecast as we've gone along here.
Samik Chatterjee -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst
Got it. And for my follow-up, I think, Chuck and Mary Jane, you both talked about sort of the mix in -- mixed sort of end-market outlook that you're seeing with certain markets remaining very strong, certain sort of pockets of weakness. If we aggregate all that together, like how is the book-to-bill looking, particularly as you sort of go through the last few months of the quarter? Like are we continuing to see sort of a step down in the aggregate book-to-bill? Or is that because of the diversification that you have remaining quite robust?
Mary Jane Raymond -- Chief Financial Officer
Well, again, the book-to-bill is not nearly as relevant really right now as the backlog itself. I mean, customers are changing their ordering patterns. But, generally, I would say there are variations certainly in bookings in particular areas where customers have had given much, much longer-dated orders in now, say, 12 months when their historical ordering pattern is more like six, so they're returning to six. But generally speaking, I would say that we're very, very positive about the outlook for the company given the strength of that backlog.
Chuck, would you like to add anything to that?
Chuck Mattera -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
No. I think what we said stands. Over the next few quarters, we can expect it to -- the book-to-bill ratio as we see it to get to more normal patterns that we would have seen before the last couple of years' events, including where the supply chain shortages started.
Samik Chatterjee -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst
OK. Thank you. Thanks for taking the questions.

Our next question comes from Mark Miller with The Benchmark Company. Your line is open.
Mark Miller -- The Benchmark Company -- Analyst
Thank you for the question. I just wanted to talk about -- you said that the supply constraints again impacted sales by 67 million. I'm wondering how that broke out between networking and lasers.
Chuck Mattera -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
It was mostly networking -- thanks for your question, by the way. Good Morning, Mark. It was -- yes, it was nearly all networking, but there was an impact to the lasers segment.
Mark Miller -- The Benchmark Company -- Analyst
I just was wondering in terms of other expense, it's jumped around the last couple of quarters. Do we expect other expense in the March quarter to be similar to what you saw in December?
Mary Jane Raymond -- Chief Financial Officer
I would say that it's probably going to be somewhat lower, probably closer to plus or minus $1 million. It does move around for an awful lot of things, some of which are still related to purchase accounting. But it's probably for Q3, plus or minus $1 million.
Mark Miller -- The Benchmark Company -- Analyst
Thank you.

Our next question comes from Jed Dorsheimer with William Blair. Your line is open.
Jed Dorsheimer -- William Blair and Company -- Analyst
Hi. Thanks. And thanks for taking my questions. I just have one and a follow-up.
I guess, Mary Jane or Chuck, did I hear correctly from a capex split, the 50% was going to silicon carbide? Could you just clarify that for me?
Mary Jane Raymond -- Chief Financial Officer
Probably in the neighborhood of 35% to 50% is going into silicon carbide. It's a significant part of our capex for the year.
Jed Dorsheimer -- William Blair and Company -- Analyst
Got it. And then I didn't hear you talk much -- and maybe I've missed this, but it seems like you have a truly differentiated position with high-quality 200-millimeter, whereas rest of the market is struggling with 150 other than one other competitors. So, I'm just curious if you could elaborate on sort of what you have that may be different or the -- without getting into process, etc., that I'm sure you wouldn't be entering. But just what would you like to say about sort of the strategy around 200.
And I think in your recent presentation, you even talked about getting to 300-millimeter.
Chuck Mattera -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
OK. Good morning, Jed. Thanks for your question. Jed, just quickly, and at a very high level that's all that's required, we have designed a process technology for growing substrates -- silicon carbide substrates around a set of materials and equipment, which we design in-house.
Our equipment, crystal growth equipment, allows us to scale such that we can grow 200-millimeter substrates in the same equipment that we grow 150. We announced in 2015 the first high-quality 200-millimeter silicon carbide substrates introduced to the marketplace. That's eight years ago. So, I would say the one thing that we have is proprietary advantage, second is a scalable platform, third is nearly 10 years of experience.
And we are dedicating some part of our capacity today, which is overwhelmingly in demand for 150-millimeter substrates. We are still dedicating capacity to improve and scale and position us for the 200-millimeter market. So, it's not a question of technology. It's really a question of capacity.
And our investments in even more capital, again, another tranche later this year and then again next year, we'll have both the market opportunity and the market demand in front of us both for 150 and 200. OK?
Jed Dorsheimer -- William Blair and Company -- Analyst
That's great. Thank you.

Next question comes from Richard Shannon with Craig-Hallum. Your line is open.
Richard Shannon -- Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- Analyst
Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe kind of a two-parter here in your broader sensing category. I guess, the first part of this is, Chuck or Giovanni, how do you see the share position with the kind of 3D sensing when you get into the next generation? Do you see an upward or downward bias to that? And then maybe can you paint us a bigger picture on the broader sensing category outside of 3D sensing? How do you see this ramping applications and kind of the thought process and time frame when that becomes a lot bigger than it is today?
Giovanni Barbarossa -- Chief Strategy Officer and President, Materials Segment
Hi, Richard. Thanks for your question. So, I think it's hard to exactly measure the share. We think that we've been growing our share, generally speaking.
And due to -- thanks to the level of [Inaudible] integration, which we think is still unique, let alone the scale that we have, so this has been very, very favorable to our ability to be very competitive, scale-wise, cost-wise, and most importantly, quality-wise. And we think that we have reached a point where we believe we are the share leader in many ways. And so we have a number of opportunities in front of us for new designs, new applications, new markets, new -- also new technologies that should be able to let us continue to enjoy this share leadership, not only in 3D but also, as I said, in optical sensing, particularly optical sensing enabled by semiconductor lasers. So, there's a number of new applications emerging, which we are working on.
You know, all of them, they are all obviously applied in many ways. And we can't really talk about all the details. But we think we are very well positioned to continue to enjoy a very close partnership and with our key customers, generally speaking.
Richard Shannon -- Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- Analyst
OK. Fair enough. Thanks for all the details, Giovanni. A follow-up on a specific topic within datacom.
You've talked about in the last few conference calls about 800 gig here. I guess it's probably my assumption, I think most people would assume that's a very small piece of your datacom business. Maybe you can just verify that's still the case or kind of give us a sense of where it's at. But I think the bigger question here is thinking about share in that category.
I think you've had to battle back from a disappointing start in the 100-, 200- to 400-gig generation. But where do you sit in 800 gig? And when does that become a more noticeable part of your business? Is that -- will that happen this calendar year, or is it more of a '24 story? Thanks.
Giovanni Barbarossa -- Chief Strategy Officer and President, Materials Segment
Yes. Thanks, Richard. Well, 800G is very early, as you know. It's still small compared to lower data rates.
But we are shipping 800G today. We think we are very competitive solution. Thanks to -- as you know, the integration of our electronics, photonics, and all the assembly and automation that we have, we have -- we think we have the most competitive platform out there. And it's definitely not going to -- something that's going to be material this fiscal year.
But next year, we'll ramp up very rapidly. And I think we're well positioned, as we've been in the past, to support the demand primarily -- as we said earlier, primarily for hyperscalers. So, we have -- I think we are very well positioned to get the larger share of the market there.
Richard Shannon -- Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- Analyst
Great. Thanks, guys. That's all for me.

Our next question comes from Tim Savageaux with Northland Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Tim Savageaux -- Northland Securities -- Analyst
Hi, good morning. Wanted to talk about kind of overall growth expectations heading forward and specifically, in fiscal '24 and moving forward. I think you've talked in the past about expectations for a double-digit growth rate for Coherent. I wonder, given some of the macro stuff that you're seeing, whether that remains the case or if you can give us any color on that.
And then along with that, as you look at your major segments across networking materials and lasers, how do you expect those three to contribute to the baseline of growth that you're expecting? Thanks.
Chuck Mattera -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Hey, Tim. Good morning. Thanks for your question. Tim, we are determined to continue this leadership position in the market.
We have another few months to play out as it relates to collecting up the new orders working on the backlog, positioning the portfolio. So, we're not going to give an FY '24 guidance today, but we are determined to outpace the growth of the market. And even with some of these pockets of softness, we have to determine whether or not we're looking at a one-quarter or a two-quarter effect. And we're intensely engaged with customers now.
So, I would say we're enthusiastic. We're making all the right bets in all the right places. We're taking full steps and making good progress even with new customers as we try to stitch together the advantages of, for example, the materials in the lasers portfolio. And it's coming along.
So, I would just leave it at, yes, it's true that our aspiration is to grow double digit into '24, but it's going to take us another few months to sort through that. And we'll provide an update over the course of the next 90 days, probably as we head into May and then possibly into August. OK?
Tim Savageaux -- Northland Securities -- Analyst
Great. Sorry, if I can follow up real quick, and I appreciate that answer. On the telecom side, you seem to put up some pretty good sequential growth there. I imagine a lot of that is driven by supply improvement.
But are there any particular product categories within telecom where you saw either strong demand or improved supply to drive that sequential growth? Thanks.
Chuck Mattera -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Tim, thanks. I'll take that one, too. I think you hit on all of them. It really was a nice mix we have had and have a good backlog.
That's true. Parts of the supply chain constraints were broken. That's true. And we do have demand across the entire telecom portfolio, Coherent transceivers, wavelength selective switches and the ROADMs, all three.
So, it's just a question of timing -- order timing and then execution of the -- through the operations, taking into account improvements, and in some cases, not so much improvement in the supply chain situation. That did hold us back somewhat on telecom again this quarter.
Tim Savageaux -- Northland Securities -- Analyst
Thanks very much.

Our next question comes from Paul Silverstein with Cowen. Your line is open.
Paul Silverstein -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst
Good morning, guys. I apologize to you and others on the call if these were already asked and answered. My line dropped. First off, I assume your previously stated 38% to 42% range but goal maintaining over 40% gross margin hasn't changed.
And, Mary Jane, any color you can provide us as to the various positive and negative levers? And I think last quarter, you cited an $8 million FX impact on gross margin. I may have that wrong, but did you mention any appreciable FX impact this quarter?
Mary Jane Raymond -- Chief Financial Officer
So, a couple of things. One, our range on the gross margin has not changed. The effects on the margin last quarter, I think, was $6 million positive. This quarter, it was $3 million negative.
So, the currency is -- there's a little havoc being played with the currencies, which is a little bit challenging. And, secondly, our cost to obtain short supply parts also increased a little bit. But having said that, it is still absolutely the company's goal to continue to push this gross margin. And, absolutely, every operating leader in our company both knows that and is behaving as a very great partner in helping to make that happen.
Paul Silverstein -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst
Mary Jane, I think virtually every company in this earnings cycle has cited ongoing supply chain challenges, but visibility as to improvement with quite a number indicating that the tougher before resolution calendar '23. Any thoughts you can share on that? And then I've got one quick follow-up.
Mary Jane Raymond -- Chief Financial Officer
I think, based on what our guy is saying, too, that it's actually a fairly decent chance that by the time we get to what would be our fiscal year '24, which is the back half of '23, that we may start to see most of the issues behind us. So, I think we still have a quarter or so to go here on it. But I do think probably by the end of the year, if not the 9/30 quarter, we should see that starting to get behind us.
Paul Silverstein -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst
OK. And I appreciate the more challenging macro environment. I know it's still precisely early with respect to the Coherent acquisition. But are there any early data points as revenue synergies with Coherent? And perhaps, Chuck, Giovanni, Mary Jane, you all could compare it to our progress with Finisar.
If I recall, I think it was within three quarters of the close of that deal that you got that Sherman facility qualified and up and shipping on the VCSELs. I think at the time, Finisar had little, if any, presence with hyperscalers. And I think you now have 3 of the big 4, and you just said it's 30% of your datacom, 15% of comms revenue. Any early signs of that nature that would speak to enhancement of Coherent's competitive position and wallet share with customers?
Chuck Mattera -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Paul, for your question. I'll go first and if Mary Jane or Giovanni like to -- or Mark would like to add, they can. I think as it relates to your question regarding revenue synergies, it's clear that, of course, there are revenue synergies that don't exist in the networking business. But across industrial, life sciences, semicap equipment, and our aerospace and defense business, there are those opportunities.
And between the key account managers, between the strategic marketing team and the product managers, especially in the businesses that Giovanni and Mark lead, there are lots of engagements that are happening, including driven by our customers themselves who are desiring to pull us together to understand how the combined portfolio can help them enable yet another disruption. So, those conversations are happening and the markets that I just described to the markets that we're focused on. And, Giovanni, would you like to add anything or Mark?
Giovanni Barbarossa -- Chief Strategy Officer and President, Materials Segment
No. Chuck, I think you summarized it well. There is no doubt, it's a very synergistic deal combination to begin with, which we really used to explain the rationale of the combination since the beginning across those four verticals that Chuck mentioned. So, I think it's -- every day is a learning opportunity for us to really figure out substantially more synergies than we ever thought during due diligence just because we were somehow limited by our relative antitrust lawyers to really talk too much about it.
And so, now, we are discovering the incredible set of combinations that we can leverage to grow the business even more.
Mark Sobey -- President, Laser Segment
Chuck, I would just add -- it's a great question, actually. I'd just add, just specifically in our instrumentation space to use that as a really easy example, our two leading customers that we typically engage with both companies separately prior to the acquisition. We might get an audience, maybe 10 or 15 people and maybe some vice presidents. And we recently at Photonics West show had meetings with two of our leading instrumentation customers with over 40 participants from each of the customers.
And we essentially got executive suite attendees there that we would previously have not done. And I think several of our customers have commented that they like the fact that they see as much more as a strategic partner rather than just maybe a leading vendor. So, I think we've got early indications in multiple markets and in multiple spaces. But that's just an easy example based Photonics West in the last few weeks.
Paul Silverstein -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst
I appreciate the responses. Thank you.

Our next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Vivek Arya -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst
Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to revisit your silicon carbide opportunity. First, with -- how much did silicon carbide contribute by way of sales for the December quarter? How much did it grow year on year? And how do you think about the growth outlook this year?
Mary Jane Raymond -- Chief Financial Officer
Chuck, if you want to take the growth question, I'll find the other ones.
Chuck Mattera -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
OK. The revenues -- Vivek, good morning. Revenues grew about 10% or so sequentially. And Mary Jane can at least range the revenues maybe with the best view for the full year.
They are growing. We expect them to continue to grow. They're capped at the kind of band of revenue that we have today on the basis of the capacity that we have installed capacity that we have in place. That capacity is being added tranche by tranche, large numbers of furnaces at a time.
And we've given some guidance over the last couple of calls as to how we expect that to evolve. Mary Jane, do you want to give a range for revenues in the [Inaudible]
Mary Jane Raymond -- Chief Financial Officer
So, the revenue is about 3% to 4% of the total company. And if you think about that having been 5% of the previous company, which was a smaller size, it showed some very, very nice growth with, as Chuck said, 10% growth year over year. The addition of capacity is very, very essential, as Chuck just described. And we're looking forward to that coming online so that we can continue to deliver on the demand that we're right now capacity-wise for.
Vivek Arya -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst
And is there an opportunity to appeal for whether it's CHIPS Act funding or other state or federal funding? Because when I look at a number of your competitors, they are building out a lot of capacity as well. So, as much as I know you are spending a lot in your capex, half of your capex or at least a third of it is going toward this opportunity, but there is a window right now to be investing in this, assuming that this is a market that you want to be a big player in. Then why not try to spend more or try to get more funding from these government agencies, so you can really take advantage of what could be a meaningful growth area for Coherent?
Chuck Mattera -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Look, Vivek, this is a meaningful growth opportunity for us, and we couldn't be more excited about it. So, we're focused on that. That's for sure. And to your point, we are in discussions with both elected officials and with government agencies, both at the federal government level in the U.S.
and at the state level. And these discussions are ongoing and growing more intense here most recently.

Our next question comes from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Meta Marshall -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst
Great. Thanks for squeezing me in. Just in terms of the China reopening, just any impact or kind of step back in what you saw in terms of supply chain challenges or just production capability, demand? Just anything to kind of note there and whether you've seen kind of getting through that past any maybe COVID waves that I've passed through there. And then as a second question just for Mary Jane, any changes to kind of minimum cash that you would want to keep on hand just given macro? Or should we still consider use of cash primarily debt pay down and capex in the near term? That's it for me.
Thanks.
Chuck Mattera -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Mary Jane, I'd like -- Mary Jane, if you would, I'll go first just on the environment in China and then if you would address the financial question. Meta, I would say as it relates to this last -- let's call it, the last 60 to 90 days or so, for us, for all intents and purposes, it's pretty much the same as it's been for the last two or three years. It's been one story: resilient, flexible, agile, enthusiastic, and able to confront whatever headwinds come and let them just blow right by. The operational team and the team in China have really just done a fantastic job despite the challenges.
And they're already on to -- looking forward to the opportunity over the next few quarters or so to position our company there as best as we possibly can.
Mary Jane Raymond -- Chief Financial Officer
With respect to the cash question, I'm pretty sure you've never met a CFO that didn't want more cash. But generally speaking, there's really no change in the minimum cash we have. And as we indicated last quarter, and you just summarized very well, we have changed our thinking a little bit to include debt paydown during fiscal year '23, as well as capex priorities. That does not slow down the speed with which we're starting the synergies, and we're going to continue along that path.
Meta Marshall -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst
Great. Thanks.

Next question comes from Tom O'Malley with Barclays. Your line is open.
Tom O'Malley -- Barclays -- Analyst
Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to dive into the electronics segment here. Could you break down, within electronics, how much of that segment is 3D sensing in the December quarter? Thank you.
Mary Jane Raymond -- Chief Financial Officer
As a general matter, sensing overall, the consumer side overall is the majority of it.
Tom O'Malley -- Barclays -- Analyst
OK. And then I think Giovanni made some comments, and I think Chuck echoed them as well that on the consumer side, the second half of the year tends to be a lot weaker than the first half of the year. There's just obviously a large cyclical customer there. But when you look at your fiscal year guide, you have an acceleration in revenue to get to your full year.
Could you just talk about what other end markets are accelerating that can offset the seasonality of the electronics segment? Thank you.
Mary Jane Raymond -- Chief Financial Officer
Well, it's pretty much the same thing we've seen for the last couple of years, at least on the legacy II-VI side, which is that the fourth quarter tends to be the strongest quarter in general. It is perhaps less enormously strong than it had been prior to 3D sensing being -- or the sensing market being in the numbers. But, generally, I'd say we would expect to see kind of typical seasonality and some strengthening in the other end markets.
Giovanni Barbarossa -- Chief Strategy Officer and President, Materials Segment
Tom, this is Giovanni. Just want to add, new features, new functions, new technology gets in and out of products all the time. What we have seen is that, generally speaking, consumer automotive, general, anywhere, there is a need for interactivity with the machine. Lasers and photodiols imaging, generally speaking, a very powerful way to sense the world and provide an AI engine inside the machine to respond and make decisions.
So, that's a trend which will continue and will also increase in terms of the actual ability to, again, sense in broader terms, not only physically but also from a -- for example, from a target perspective, they need different type of sources. Depending on the application, there's a different level of power, etc. So, we have seen and you guys have seen, as the number of lasers, a number of photodiodes, the number of solution that get added to consumer electronics products. And then automotive, inside or outside the cat, it just will keep increasing.
So, it's not whether or not -- of course, there's going to be more phones, more cars sold eventually and maybe more phones. But it's even assuming that more phones have saturated as a number, we think that the adoption of this technology will continue to grow. And so, you can expect future products to be adopted to enhance the functionality of these products.
Mary Jane Raymond -- Chief Financial Officer
Also, let me just clarify something. I should have helped Chuck here more. On our silicon carbide growth, the answer is that it's 10% -- the growth is 10% year over year. And it's pretty flat sequentially for exactly the same reason Chuck gave, which is the capacity constraint.

Our next question comes from Ruben Roy with Stifel. Your line is open.
Ruben Roy -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst
Thank you. Chuck, a lot of detail so far. But if we could spend a minute on -- there's a comment in the press release around the pricing and thoughtfully increasing pricing in some areas. Obviously, the -- with the business becoming more diversified, wondering if you could just kind of maybe give us a little bit of detail around how you're seeing the pricing environment evolve, especially in the context of input costs and supply constraints improving.
And then I guess you talked about positioning the portfolio of the diversified company and how that's playing into how you're thinking about longer-term pricing strategy, that would be helpful. Thanks.
Chuck Mattera -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
OK. I'll start -- thanks for your question. I'll start, and then, I'll ask Giovanni to add on to it and provide even more color. In these last six months, we put the entire product management team of the whole combined company through a fairly rigorous training cycle.
And those product managers in conjunction with -- in connection with the global sales and service organization have had a strategic imperative to improve the operating margins and to position us for competitive pricing that reflect the true value that we bring to the marketplace. Those conversations have been going on even long before we combined with legacy Coherent, but we really stepped it up in the last six months. And whereas you'd like to do it across the board, it's not practical. And so, you have to be focused on it.
You have to have a strategy for it and an intimacy with the customers with regard to a long-range value proposition and a long-range partnership, which we always focus on developing. And, Giovanni, do you want to point out one or two examples of success in the last six to 12 months?
Giovanni Barbarossa -- Chief Strategy Officer and President, Materials Segment
Sure, Chuck. Yes, we had -- we've been quite successful in a very cooperative environment with our customers, understanding that some of our costs, particularly in those products that require transformation, so we talk about material processing, material transformation, where there is a significant amount of energy needed, we have been able to increase price in a reasonable way. And I think that the customers have been very pleased. In some cases, we have been offered price increases to -- by the customer to secure share in this kind of environment, where they realize that there could have been a risk of supply.
So, it's been a combination of us -- asking us to increase prices, which we've been quite successful with. And then, customers, in some cases, offering price increases to again continue and secure the continual supply for some of these products, which, again, have been affected by a number of inflationary effects that we all know, particularly around energy supply.

Our next question comes from Mike Genovese with Rosenblatt. Your line is open.
Mike Genovese -- Rosenblatt Securities -- Analyst
Thanks so much. Thanks for squeezing me in. First question, now that we're in the good part of the 400G data center transceiver cycle, can you talk a bit [Technical difficulty] 400G versus 100G, if it's meaningfully different? And then, importantly, is there are any technology moats that you can build in 400G versus 100G because of the greater investment needed in the technology? Thank you.
Giovanni Barbarossa -- Chief Strategy Officer and President, Materials Segment
So, first of all, just for the sake of clarity, as you know, we say 200, 400, 800, 1.6G. As far as we know, it's all about 100 gigabits per second. And then you're talking about data rates. So, we have to distinguish between -- speed and data rates are not exactly the same.
So, even at 400G may actually be four times 100. And 200, maybe two times 100. 200G, we have wireline 200G. We just announced an EML at the European conference last September.
It's best in the world, we think, and eventually will be a significant shift in bits per second, not necessarily as a data rate but as a speed. So, all of those complications of combining 100G optical lanes into 200, 400, 800, they have several solutions, several standards. It's -- we have potentially the ability to support all of those form factors, all of those data rates. And we, obviously, own a substantial vertical level -- sorry, vertical level of integration in terms of the lasers, in terms of the ICs, in terms of the optics that go into those products.
So, I wouldn't necessarily claim -- and nobody could claim that there is a strength in 400G, but there is no strength in 200G or vice versa because the strength is at the bit rate level -- sorry, the strength is at the speed level, not necessarily at a bit rate level. So, I think we are well positioned at 100G. We are already well positioned for 200G speed. And so, all of the data rates from 200G and above, I think, we're very well positioned to, again, as I said earlier, to continue to gain share in the marketplace.
We are seeing -- just to give you an -- just last year, we were at about maybe 15%, and it went to 30%. And now, we're about 50% of the total datacom sales are actually at 200G and above, which is a sign that we are really focused on the high end of the market, thanks to the -- again, the combination of the portfolio, component level that we own and we are better integrated with.
Mike Genovese -- Rosenblatt Securities -- Analyst
Great. Very helpful. If I could follow up, just another question on the R&D path. Your name is Coherent, but I'm not aware of any DSP products or for 400 ZR or any DSP products at the company.
Do you have R&D in DSPs? And what are your thoughts on adding DSPs going forward?
Giovanni Barbarossa -- Chief Strategy Officer and President, Materials Segment
Yeah. We should probably take it off-line because we did announce in the past of our own DSPs, and we have -- of course, we have several Coherent products. We have an entire division around it. And we'll walk you through all of the offerings.
We are very well positioned. We have started with our own -- we have our own DSP design team based in Germany. And we have started with, I would call it, a simple product. And we'll eventually migrate to more complex products over time and be as basically integrated as we can be with our own DSP.
That's our plan. We have to -- we started. We are on a good path. The most significant of the products, of course, the 100G ZR, which adds its own DSP in it, and we announced couple of quarters ago.
And so, that's an example. But we'll walk you through when we are one-on-one with more details if you like.
Mike Genovese -- Rosenblatt Securities -- Analyst

Welcome to Coherent Corp.'s FY '23 Q2 earnings call. This is a listen-only session until the Q&A, hosted by CFO Mary Jane Raymond.

Mary Jane Raymond -- Chief Financial Officer:
Today's call, on February 8, 2023, includes forward-looking statements involving risks detailed in our most recent Form 10-K.

Chuck Mattera -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer:
Coherent posted $1.37 billion in revenue, up 70% year-over-year. Sales distribution remained consistent with previous quarters by region. Our non-GAAP EPS was $0.95. Capex was notably geared towards our silicon carbide platform, crucial for EV market and renewable energy sectors. The company experienced growth across all sectors, notably a 131% increase in the Electronics segment led by sensing technologies.

We plan to continue investments, especially in the silicon carbide substrates to meet the rising demand, likely outpacing EV market growth. Communications, led by telecom and datacom, grew due to robust demand in broadband and data center sectors. Industrial revenue was mixed, with growth in EUV lithography and electric vehicle batteries manufacturing, offset by softer performance in advanced packaging and back-end semiconductor applications. The move to NYSE on February 23 aligns with our global stature and growing aspirations.

Mary Jane Raymond:
Currency impacts were relatively minimal at a $6 million difference. The total debt was $4.6 billion, with a leverage ratio outlook maintaining existing forecasts. For Q3 FY '23, revenue is expected between $1.32 billion and $1.37 billion with non-GAAP EPS of $0.75 to $0.90. Full-year revenue is projected within $5.35 billion to $5.55 billion range.

Good afternoon, and welcome to MACOM's fourth fiscal quarter 2019 conference call. This conference call is being recorded today Tuesday, November 12, 2019. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. I will now turn the call over to Mr.
Steve Ferranti, MACOM's vice president of investor relations. Mr. Ferrant, please go ahead.
Steve Ferranti -- Vice President of Investor Relations
Thank you, Liz. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to MACOM's fourth fiscal quarter 2019 earnings conference call. I would like to remind everyone that our discussion today will contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to certain risks and uncertainties as defined in the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed today.
For more detailed discussions of the risks and uncertainties that could result in those differences, we refer you to MACOM's filing with the SEC. Management's statements during this call will include discussion to certain adjusted non-GAAP financial information. A reconciliation of GAAP to adjusted non-GAAP results are provided in the company's press release and related Form 8-K, which was filed with the SEC today. With that, I will turn over the call to Steve Daly, president and CEO of MACOM.
Steve Daly -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, and good afternoon. I will begin today's call with a general company update. After that, Jack Kober, our chief financial officer, will provide a more in-depth review of our Q4 and full-year financial results. When jack is finished, I will provide revenue and earnings guidance for our fiscal Q1 2020, and then we would be happy to take some questions from our listeners.
In the fourth fiscal quarter, our revenue was $112.2 million and our adjusted net income was $0.01 per diluted share. The company achieved non-GAAP profitability, primarily a result of the major restructuring we announced in June. Change at MACOM continues at a rapid pace. In July and August, we evaluated the strengths and weaknesses of our company's organizational structure.
We also reviewed our new product introduction processes and policies, our R&D projects in a variety of sales, business and operational behaviors and process flows. After the review was completed, we established a new organization, which was announced to our employees in the middle of September. We also established a priority list to address opportunities across the business. To review, our leadership includes five senior Vice Presidents organized by function, namely sales, operations, finance, technology, and legal and HR, and engineering is now organized by technology.
And each technology group will manage its own product development, product launches and technology roadmaps. These six engineering organizations will support one or more of our end markets, namely industrial and defense, data center and telecom. The new structure eliminates a layer of management, and we believe that it will streamline decision-making and improve accountability. Nine of my 11 direct reports are either new to their position or are in a significantly different or expanded role.
Our management team is complete and has extensive leading industry experience. Our new structure moves away from a matrix organization and toward a technology and product line organization. Our new structure places all resources necessary to introduce a product, namely chip design, package design, test software, product engineering and qualification under one organization and one person. The same organization will also manage application engineering in all post sales technical support.
This structure, along with our just revised new product introduction, or NPI procedure, reduces handoffs between departments, eliminates bureaucracy, and it will improve our ability to set and hold priorities. Most importantly, it will support increased accountability at the product line level. Our Q4 revenue by end market was as follows: industrial and defense was $50.1 million, up 7% sequentially; data center was $22.6 million, up 28% sequentially; and telecom $39.6 million, down 10% sequentially. Our data center revenue showed improved performance following three quarters of decline.
Our industrial and defense revenue was driven by various U.S. Defense programs, as well as increased sales to our tested measurement customers. And our telecom revenue declined sequentially, primarily due to weakness in GPON. Overall, our three core end markets are strong and full of opportunity for MACOM.
And I believe our new focus on product development and execution will allow us to win market share more efficiently. On a geographic basis, 48% of our fourth quarter revenue was from domestic customers and 52% was from international customers, similar to prior periods. Our book-to-bill ratio was 1.1:1 and our churns business or business booked and shipped within the quarter was 31% of our total revenue. Our operations team is doing a great job focusing on planning and executing linear shipments throughout the quarter, which we anticipate will improve cash flows, AR and customer satisfaction.
We have established an internal working fiscal-year 2020 annual operating plan. This plan includes a detailed bottoms-up revenue forecast, based on known design wins on identified programs. It also contains a bottom-up operating expense and capital equipment budget. In addition, we completed a first pass review of all R&D projects currently being funded to ensure the priorities and the budgets are aligned.
The management team and I are confident we can improve our financial performance during our FY 2020. To ensure we remain focused, we have established a top 10 priority list for the company, which underscores to the management and all employees are key strategic initiatives for long-term growth and profitability. Additionally, all members of the leadership team have individual top 10 priority lists to support corporate objectives. As we enter our 2020 fiscal year, we are focused on completing products in our pipeline, which will help drive MACOM's near and long-term growth.
Our three primary markets are large and provide MACOM significant growth opportunities. For example, we support major OEMs in our industrial and defense end market with our leading L GaAs Diode products. These products are designed into a number of new radar and aircraft platforms that will be deployed over the next few years. And we have a wide range of technologies and products for our telecom end market.
For example, we believe our high-performance analog drivers, TIAs and APDs for 5G front haul are among the best-in-class and our 64-gigabaud coherent driver in TIA products for deployment in the next-generation of metro long haul optical networks are winning market share. We continue to have success in the data center with a well-established line of high-performance analog components, including drivers, TIAs and CDRs for 100G deployments, along with new designs being introduced for 200G applications. The opportunities that I've just outlined are based on established MACOM products that we have in production today. These products set the foundation of MACOM and should provide MACOM with profit and revenue growth in the coming months and quarters.
Our portfolio also contains new technologies, which are still emerging, including GaN-on-Silicon, high-speed lasers, coherent and PAM4 DSPs and silicon photonics. These technologies are compelling and our engineers continue to make solid technical progress to move these technologies closer to productization. We recognize that these technologies have the potential to generate significant revenues and profits in the years ahead. Further details and updates will be made as we make progress, and after the associated products are launched and generating revenue.
I'll highlight a few notable events that occurred during the fourth quarter. First, MACOM attended this year's CIOE or China international optoelectronic exposition in Shenzhen. We hosted a live demonstration of an open eye MSA-compliant 200G PAM4 chipset for data center applications. This chipset includes our high-performance CDR with integrated laser driver on the transmit side.
On the receive side, the chipset includes MACOM photodetectors, a quad TIA and a four-channel receive CDR. We view this solution as a great example of MACOM's product breadth, technology and industry. leadership. Second, during the quarter, we began production of a SIPRI compliant combo chip for 5G front haul length ranging from 500 meters to 20 kilometers.
This chip integrates a DML laser driver with a limiting amplifier, dual CDRs, power management and diagnostics. We also recently introduced a Trans-Impedance Amplifier, which supports data rates of up to 28 gigabits per second with very low power consumption. When used in combination, these products can provide our customers a complete solution for low-cost, low-power 25G SFP modules for 5G front haul applications. And third, we have released a very competitive front-end module or FEM, targeting massive MIMO 5G deployments.
This product utilizes multiple technologies, including a Silicon-On-Insulator, or SOI switch in a gallium arsenide low-noise amplifier. The product offers high power switching capability and a high-gain, low-loss, low-noise figure receive side functionality. And lastly, we expanded our mimic portfolio to include a family of high-performance space shifters. MACOM's engineering did an outstanding job designing all of these unique and best-in-class products.
Supplementing our design engineering efforts, our operations team is working to improve our gross margins, including launching new projects, targeting wafer fab, yield enhancements, reduction of scrap, cycle time reduction and lowering the costs from our key suppliers. We expect that these behind the scenes efforts will generate new profits directly create shareholder value it will appear in our financial results in the coming quarters. Our purchasing and logistics team have done a great job embracing aggressive cost saving goals. The management team continues to evaluate all aspects of our business, including technology road maps, R&D investments, product line strategies, sales and pricing strategies, operational and supply chain activities and company positioning within our three core markets.
Jack will now provide a more detailed review of our Q4 and full-year financial results.
John Kober -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased that we have returned to non-GAAP profitability here in our fiscal fourth quarter after reporting two quarters of non-GAAP losses. I would like to thank all of the MACOM employees who've been working hard to help achieve this. Revenue in fiscal Q4 was $112.2 million, up 4% sequentially and down 26% from $151.2 million in Q4 fiscal 2018.
The year-over-year decline was primarily driven by a combination of softness in data center demand and a decline in PON sales. Adjusted gross profit and adjusted gross margin in fiscal Q4 were $59.5 million and 53% of revenue, respectively. Gross margin remains a key focal point for us, and we see opportunities for continued improvements beyond Q4 levels. As revenue improves over time, and depending on our product mix, we expect to see an associated improvement in gross margin.
Total adjusted operating expense was $51.1 million, which consisted of R&D expense of $32.4 million and SG&A expense of $18.7 million. Total operating expense was down approximately $13.9 million, or 21% sequentially, primarily due to the impact of the restructuring actions we took in fiscal Q3 of 2019. We are on plan to realize the full $50 million of annualized savings from these actions by the end of fiscal Q2 2020. Adjusted operating income in the fourth quarter was $8.5 million, translating into 7.6% operating margin.
We incurred $2.5 million of restructuring charges in the fourth fiscal quarter and expect to incur additional restructuring charges of approximately $3 million during fiscal 2020, as we complete these actions. Depreciation expense for fiscal Q4 was $7.3 million and adjusted EBITDA was $15.8 million. Adjusted net interest expense was approximately $7.6 million. Our non-GAAP adjusted income tax rate in fiscal Q4 continued at 8% and resulted in an expense of less than $100,000.
Fiscal Q4 adjusted net income was $806,000, translating into $0.01 of earnings per fully diluted share utilizing a share count of 66.7 million fully diluted shares. Now moving on to cash flow and balance items. Cash flow from operations was negative $7.6 million in fiscal Q4, attributed mainly to a reduction in payables, as well as severance-related restructuring cash payments. We have taken steps to improve cash generation going forward, including the previously announced restructuring action, focused capital spending, tight operating expense management, as well as managing our working capital.
As a result of these actions, we expect positive operating cash flow in Q1 of fiscal 2020. Fiscal Q4 capital expenditures totaled $6.1 million, or 5.4% of revenue. We continue to closely manage all of our spending during the quarter and rescheduled certain capital expenditures into the first-half of fiscal 2020. Despite this, we expect overall capital expenditures in fiscal 2020 to be below fiscal 2019 levels.
We remain closely focused on achieving appropriate returns on capital that we employed. Q4 free cash flow was negative $13.6 million as compared to negative $7.9 million in Q3, primarily as a result of the lower Q4 cash flow from operations, partially offset by lower capital expenditures in the fourth quarter. Inventories were $107.9 million at quarter end, down $2.7 million sequentially. Inventory turns were 2.0 times during the fourth quarter.
We continue to prioritize inventory management and do see opportunities for continued improvement in our inventory metrics going forward. As of September 2019 fiscal year end, cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $176.7 million, down $9.1 million from $185.8 million at the end of fiscal Q3. As a reminder, our short-term investments are comprised of corporate bonds and commercial paper and are classified as held-for-sale. Total long-term debt was $684.7 million, inclusive of capital leases.
Our long-term debt of $655 million, which is covenant-light has minimal annual principal repayment until its maturity in May 2024. MACOM also has an undrawn $160 million credit line available through November 2021. Before turning it back to Steve, there are a couple of accounting items I would like to provide commentary on. We had a one-time non-cash GAAP tax benefit of approximately $37 million in Q4 associated with a planned intercompany transfer of assets between two of our international legal entities.
We do not expect this to affect our non-GAAP tax rate going forward. Also, in keeping with best practices going forward, we will no longer report non-GAAP revenue and we have updated historical periods. This has resulted in the shift of revenue of $7 million and adjusted EPS of $0.10 from the third-quarter 2018 to the second quarter of 2019. This update is reflected on our earnings release and impacts year-to-date amounts.
As such, for the full-year ended September 2019, revenue was $499.7 million, adjusted operating income was $10.9 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share was a negative $0.29. So in summary, we are pleased with our progress in Q4 2019. As Steve previously noted, we recently prepared our fiscal-year 2020 internal annual operating plan, which lays out a path toward continued improvements in profitability and cash flow. While there's still a lot of work for us to do in order to achieve our longer-term objectives, we believe that we are entering fiscal 2020 with positive momentum.
I will now turn the discussion back over to Steve.
Steve Daly -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Jack. MACOM expects revenue in Q1 FY 2020, ending January 3, 2020 to be in the range of $113 million to $117 million. Adjusted gross margin is expected to be in the range of 53% to 55% and adjusted earnings per share is expected to be between $0.01 and $0.05 per share, based on $67.5 million fully diluted shares. Our Q1 revenue projections include expectations that all three of our end markets will grow sequentially.
Growth will be led by our data center end market, followed by growth in our telecom and industrial and defense end markets. In summary, we are excited about the multiple revenue growth opportunities in front of us and we are focused on execution and planning. We continue to evaluate all aspects of the business, including technology roadmaps, R&D investments, product line strategies, sales strategies, operational and supply chain activities and company positioning within the markets we serve. I would now like to ask the operator to take any questions.
Questions & Answers:
Operator
[Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Harsh Kumar with Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.
Harsh Kumar -- Piper Jaffray -- Analyst
Yes. Hey, guys, congratulations on very strong results and continued progress here. I think, Steve, when you're talking about the guidance, you're saying all end markets will grow. I get the data center side, we're getting a lot of data points about the data center side growing.
But I was curious what is turning around in the â particularly in the telecom side for you and that is coming back us from, I mean, I guess, from such a deficit that you reported in the September quarter, I'd be curious. And then also, perhaps what is working on the defense and industrial side?
Steve Daly -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Sure. So on the telecom side, our growth is being driven primarily by 5G front haul. We're seeing some of our high-performance analog products have success there. So we're pleased about that.
And then on our defense side, it has, as I pointed out in the script, a lot to do with our radar programs and airborne receiver programs that we support.
Harsh Kumar -- Piper Jaffray -- Analyst
OK, great. And then is â a lot of the companies are now saying parts of Huawei business can be recognized. I would just wanted to clarify is, is Huawei one of the things that's coming back for you, or how are you looking at that particular piece of a particular customer?
Steve Daly -- President and Chief Executive Officer
I would say, it's not coming back. I would say it's going down, that's the trend. So as we look forward in terms of our growth, we think we'll continue to grow, even as our Huawei business declines. We'd like to think this is temporary.
And perhaps in the future, when â if and when they come off the entity list, then we'll certainly reengage and that could provide us some potential upside. But all of our planning, all of our focus right now is certainly ex-Huawei.
Harsh Kumar -- Piper Jaffray -- Analyst
OK. And last one for me. Data Center was a big number two or three quarters ago and dropped down to about 16, 17 now it's back up in the 20s. What is the real number that we should be thinking about that you can â that's a legitimate number for us to think about in terms of you getting back â your company getting back to that level?
Steve Daly -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Well, I think there's going to be two phases. The near-term phase will be, I would say, incremental growth due to our contributions to 100G platforms, where we have very competitive CDRs, TIAs and drivers. I think, as we look out, maybe two or three quarters, we'll supplement that with leading TIAs, as well as what I would consider, high frequency opto drivers. And then a little bit further out from there, we think our photodetectors and our silicon photonics will start to contribute.
So the near term, it's going to be a lot of the HPA products that we've been very successful with. As the data rates go up, specifically 400G, we have products that are winning sockets, as I mentioned, the TIA is the drivers in some of our detectors and then long-term silicon photonics.

Our next question comes from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Your line is now open.
Tom O'Malley -- Barclays -- Analyst
Hey guys. This is Tom O'Malley on for Blayne Curtis, congratulations on the nice results here. I wanted to start with just forming of the new organization. And you guys have done a good job of kind of describing here how you have a top 10 priority list and different areas where you're focused on the business and you highlighted a couple in the script.
Can you talk about just in terms of growth of those opportunities that you laid out, where you're most excited and where you could see the most growth? Obviously, data center is starting to reaccelerate now, but is there an area where you think that you could really see a revenue profile change in the business overall?
Steve Daly -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Right. So yes, I think there is and I think some of those transformational step ups in revenue are certainly out in the future. In terms of the near term, which is what we're really focused on, I think, we're going to see incremental growth from product-driven strategies based on our existing portfolio. So we're looking at things like the front-end modules that I talked about.
We're looking at all sorts of components for 5G front haul. When I look at our mimic product line, I think, there's tremendous opportunities to embellish the current portfolio set. So I wouldn't want to necessarily call out any one particular product area or technology group, I think, they all have tremendous growth opportunity. Remember, MACOM right now, as Jack said, last year, we were just under $500 million.
We are very small relative to the size of the markets that we serve. So with our breadth of technology, including the diodes, the mimics, the high-performance analog components, as well as then the lightweight components, when we look at the laser portfolio, when we look at our photodetectors and then the silicon photonics, which is certainly very interesting and then, of course, the power. I'll mention that. We are very active.
And part of our reorganization was certainly, updating the organization and the strategy around our power and GaN activities. So each one of these groups has tremendous opportunity for growth. We have put in place what I believe very rational and aggressive business savvy leaders that will drive the technology roadmaps, as well as keep a keen eye on budget. So I think we have the right team.
I think we have the right technology set. And our goal here is to certainly win more market share than we've done in the past.
Harsh Kumar -- Piper Jaffray -- Analyst
Great. That's really helpful. And then I just wanted to dive into some of the longer-term opportunities you talked about as well. You mentioned the PAM4 DSP, silicon photonics, GaN-on-Silicon.
I think, before the transition, there was a policy of focusing on things a little further out. But I think that people have continued to ask on the opportunity with GaN-on-Silicon just given how present 5G is going into 2020. And at a time, I think that was one of your â the businesses larger drivers. Can you update us on where that stands with you today from a more conservative view? And what do you guys think you have in terms of technology and what the size of that market may be for you?
Steve Daly -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Sure. Maybe I'll just give a quick GaN update. So just to remind everybody, we are today shipping, again, on silicon amplifiers and components, primarily for 4G and high reliability mobile radios, military manpack type radios. And that's a very â these are very successful sockets that customers are really enjoying the performance of the products.
I think over the next 12 months, we'll see incremental growth within this product set. The second area, perhaps that you've alluded to, is our activity with â working with ST. That program continues. The recent update is the capital equipment is now moving toward ST.
We are focused very much on really polishing the specifications that were Looking at in terms of process technology, as well as working with ST on schedules. We've recently done a complete review of pricing with ST to make sure we fully understand the cost of the technology when we're at high volume production. And I think those conversations were very productive. And so that that program is on schedule.
I won't go any further than that other than to remind everybody that this is a significant technology development. The third item is, I'll point out regarding GaN-on, as we reorganized, we combined our traditional GaN-on-Silicon team with our group that was focused on bipolar transistors. We put them all under one organization and that has a benefit, because now we're bringing a broader capability to the engineering team. We are also, I'll point out, opening up the aperture slightly regarding our GaN-on-Silicon and GaN-on-Silicon carbide strategy.
We're now having our technologists do baseline characterization on different GaN-on-Silicon carbide transistors. We believe that there is a place for this technology in our portfolio, especially at the higher powers, the higher frequencies and some of our military and satellite customers are very interested in having MACOM participate here. So we are opening up the aperture and we're bringing engineering efforts to really establish a baseline of where the industry is regarding, I'll say half micron, 0.4 micron, as well as 0.25 and even 0.1 micron GaN-on-Silicon carbide. And so we believe over the long term, our engineers should have access to the best technologies there are.
As I mentioned, actually, on our last call, we have two foundries internally, but we also deal with nine external foundries. And so we want our power amplifier group to be able to have access to the best technologies. Now this will absolutely complement our GaN-on-Silicon efforts. We today still believe that GaN-on-Silicon is the right process for massive MIMO, given the volumes, given the price points and given the low power levels.
So this is not going to take away from that effort, it will certainly be additive.

Our next question comes from Quinn Bolton with Needham & Company. Your line is open.
Quinn Bolton -- Needham and Company -- Analyst
Hey, Steve. I wanted just to get an update on the lasers, I think, when you took over as CEO, you've sort of implemented a review of the laser manufacturing and with an effort to try and reduce some of the scrap. Can you sort of tell us where you are in that effort to raise yields on the 25-gig lasers? And then a follow-up question, you had mentioned some new products that FEMs and space shifters for sort of the 5G applications. What kind of timeframe should we be thinking about in terms of revenue generation from those FEMs and space shifters?
Steve Daly -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Sure. So on the laser front, as you know, we have three different markets we service with our lasers. We have different data rates. We have different laser structures.
And these lasers are used in different modulation schemes. So when we talk about 25G lasers, there's probably about six different versions of that.So let me talk about the near term and the laser revenues that we think will generate over the next 12 months, let's say. Certainly, 2.5G PON is an important market for the company. It's been soft recently.
We've had a lot of inventory in the channel over the last couple of quarters. So we â it really hasn't been contributing to our top line. We think that'll change in about a quarter or two. Things will start to pick up.
And that's an area where we've been very successful. That's, of course, for the access market, let's say. We think over time, the market will move to 10G, and we are working on the development of a laser for that market. It's early days. We're still in development mode, let's say.
And I would put that toward, maybe nine to 12 months away, we should be in a position, where we're having traction in the market with some of our products. When you talk about 25G lasers, I'll focus the conversation on 25G FP. This is a growth area for the company. We do expect to see new revenue to the â to our top line in the next 12 months.
This is primarily for 5G front haul applications. We think that we have some technical advantages over the competitors, and so we're taking advantage of that. And it will absolutely â it'll probably be the shining, the bright shining light of the laser portfolio in the next 12 months. And then the last product I'll talk about specifically is our 10G FP lasers, which have historically been very strong in the market, supporting 4G LTE backhaul.
And that volume has been coming down for obvious reasons as those base station deployments are declining and other deployments are taking over. In terms of the CW lasers and the DFB lasers for the data center, I would put all of those lasers in the category of R&D and product development. We still have a lot of work to do within our fab to dial things in with those lasers. One mistake we won't make again is starting production before we have a product that's fully qualified and will run a high yield.
So it's absolutely unacceptable to be having these large scraps or write-offs due to starting production and then ultimately having the product fail the call or have a very low yield. So we won't be doing that again. I guess, you added â sorry, you added also a question about our FEMs and space shifters. The FEM revenue, we expect in this fiscal year.
The space shifters also this fiscal year, I'll just highlight the space shifters. These are low-to-medium volume, high ASP-type products. So it's â it'll be buried within the portfolio.

Our next question comes from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Your line is now open.
Tore Svanberg -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst
Yes. Thank you, and congratulations on the diligent process here. Steve, could you talk a little bit about any sort of product or product lines you may have shutdown or pruned, I mean, obviously, you have a $50 million opex reduction? So any visibility you can share with us on product lines, or technologies that may have been shutdown or prudent at this point?
Steve Daly -- President and Chief Executive Officer
I can only mention the one that we previously discussed on our last call, which was the optical modules for data centers. That's one we â that we've highlighted that we have exited that business. We think that was the right decision even today. But I can't really add any more comments in terms of pruning, or focusing, or deemphasizing product lines.
That's certainly part of our strategic planning process. And our internal reviews are, these are things we constantly do. And so, we've not made any announcements at this point on that particular question.
Tore Svanberg -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst
That's very clear. As a follow-up and when you talked about sort of the long term and technologies that have potential, you mentioned PAM4 DSP, that I think, near-term you kind of also working more on PAM4 more from an analog perspective. So could you reconcile those two for us? And do you intend to actually invest in both analog and potential with PAM4 DSP?
Steve Daly -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yes. We have, as you know, we have a few DSP programs under way. We have actually two captured customers. And we plan on adding a third DSP at some point in time to our portfolio.
And so, there's a coherent version and there's a PAM4 DSP version. I really don't want to go into any more details on that. So that's â those are programs that the company has been working on for a number of years. We're not providing any updates tonight in terms of the status of those programs other than we continue to work on them.
Regarding other areas where we contribute to sort of PAM4 products, 200G and 400G areas, where we have, what I consider, the HPA products. These are CDRs, drivers, TIAs. These would all fit nicely inside of a â an analog PAM4 solution.
Operator
Our next question comes from Harlan Sur with JP Morgan. Your line is now open.
Harlan Sur -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst
Good afternoon, and congrats on the solid execution. I'm thinking about the longer-term gross margin potential for MACOM. And if I look at your catalog products of mimics and diodes and switches and whatnot, most of these products that are probably situated in your IND business and maybe some in your telecom business, in your prior company, these parts are driving 70%-plus gross margins. What's the gross margin profile of MACOM's catalog business relative to that 70%-plus profile? And if there is a large difference, if you can, maybe help us understand why?
Steve Daly -- President and Chief Executive Officer
OK. So I'm not sure we typically provide the gross margin by product line or by product set, as an example, the catalog business that you mentioned. And I will say that we have the continuum of gross margins. We have products that are above 70%.
We have products that are below our corporate average. So what you're, of course, seeing is a blended average. Jack, do you want to comment more on that?
John Kober -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Just â I mean, with regard to our overall margins, look into to definitely make improvements over time. We realized where we're at, from an industry perspective, and we want to get to that that above average phase at some point in time in the future. So, focusing on the margin improvement is an area that we have with our guidance here in Q1. We've got a bit of an uptick in the guidance range that we've put for the gross margin.
Harlan Sur -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst
Yes. An I appreciate the insights there. And the team has been engaged in a number of active antenna programs for both civil and defense-related initiatives with the SPAR power architecture. Can you guys just give us an update on these programs and revenue contribution or maybe potential timing of tangible revenue contribution?
Steve Daly -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yes, I would â we look at the â that particular program, the sensor program that you're talking about is a long-term program. I don't think it will be adding any material revenue to our top line in the next 12 months. We continue to engage customers that are interested in the technology. We've put together what we think is a very interesting architecture.
We have done an outstanding job with the packaging technology that's associated with this platform. And so we continue to share our information and our technology with the major primes. But I would say, for the next 12 months, I would temper expectations there. The main radar programs that we are looking at are really long-term programs that are, I would characterize as being in their infancy regarding having the end customer define the requirement.
So we're talking about many years before significant contribution to the top line.

Our next question comes from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Mark Delaney -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst
Yes, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions and thanks for all the details on the efforts under way at the company. The first question was on the 2020 plan. Steve, you mentioned the company has a plan in place for, I think, you said revenue cost and potentially free cash flow.
Are there any more details you can share with investors about what those metrics may look like?
Steve Daly -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Not specifically.
Mark Delaney -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst
OK. Maybe just a follow-up on â then on our bookings. If my math is right, I think you said book-to-bill was 1.1 and a second quarter in a row, I think, of a positive book-to-bill, which is nice to see. I think the absolute bookings numbers may be down a little bit in terms of dollars, maybe down about 5% quarter on quarter, but obviously with a positive book-to-bill.
Anything you can share in terms of kind of the absolute change in bookings versus last quarter, or is it just sort of normal quarter-to-quarter fluctuations or any areas where we're bookings were a bit softer?
John Kober -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yes, Mark, this is Jack. So quarter over quarter the bookings were about flat, maybe a little bit up. But based on the lower revenue we had last quarter in Q3, that drove obviously a higher book-to-build ratio of 1.2.
Mark Delaney -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst
OK, all right. That's helpful clarification. And my last one, Jack, I think, you guided for positive operating cash flow for next quarter, which very nice to see after kind of what was reported this current quarter, and there's a lot of work under way to get there. In terms of free cash flow, when should we think about the positive free cash flow? Thanks.
John Kober -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yes, obviously, cash flow continues to be an area of focus and historically has been an area of focus for us. Even if you look at our full-year 2019, we did generate positive operating cash flow of around $20 million to $21 million. So we want to make sure we're staying focused on that piece of it. Here in the fourth quarter, we did have some cash flow headwinds, as I had described, including some cash payments associated with the restructuring action.
So that was a bit of a headwind here in Q4. Some of that will linger on, as we've noted, with some of those restructuring costs working the way into the remainder of 2020. But we do feel relatively confident about our cash flow, specifically the operating cash flow side of things. Capital can tend to be a bit lumpy, as we had described, so you know that that would obviously impact our free cash flow.
So it's going to continue to be a â an area of focus for us as we go out into the future. And, as Stephen and I had mentioned, our internal operating plan does provide for cash flow improvements, as we work our way through the years.

We have a follow-up question from the line of Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Your line is now open.
Tore Svanberg -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst
Yes, thank you. I just had a follow-up for Jack. So just to clarify, because you're going to be reporting GAAP numbers going forward. The guidance you gave, is that a GAAP guidance or a non-GAAP guidance, especially on the EPS number?
John Kober -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
I know that was non-GAAP guidance between $0.01 and $0.05 for Q1?
Tore Svanberg -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst
Very good. OK, very good. And will you be sharing with us some of your non-cash items, stock comp and things like that when you do publish the GAAP numbers?
John Kober -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yes, as we've â as detailed in the earnings release, there is a full reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP. All those items are listed out.
Tore Svanberg -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst
Now that I mean, since you're moving to GAAP-only, I'm just â I want to make â just wondering what the â what you will be sharing with us going forward?
John Kober -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
I think the clarification there then is, in terms of our guidance, it's non-GAAP-related. I think the point that you might be making is, we did make an adjustment here in terms of our GAAP revenue to non-GAAP revenue. We had historically had some differences and we clean that legacy item up here in the fourth quarter. It had no impact on the current quarter, it was more of a legacy item that we were addressing with the change.
Tore Svanberg -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst
Sounds good. Thank you.

We have a follow-up question from the line of Harsh Kumar with Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.
Harsh Kumar -- Piper Jaffray -- Analyst
Yes. Hey, thanks for opportunity to ask a follow-up. Clearly, I mean, your comments sound like things are moving, your company should be able to grow revenues. I was curious how we should think about operating expenses going forward, particularly into December and then also beyond that as revenue goes? And then my second question was, if you, Jack, maybe if you take out the severance piece, how does the free cash flow look a quarter two, quarters out or whatever timeframe you want to pick to talk about it?
John Kober -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yes. So from an operating expense perspective, we came in here in the fourth quarter around $51 million, a little bit north of that. Our guidance kind of get you to that rough range for the Q1 time period. Q1 does have some headwinds that that we would be facing at the beginning of our merit process.
So, I think coming in at that level feels right. And from a cash flow perspective, as we had mentioned, some of those restructuring items was a headwind that hit us here in the fourth quarter. It's roughly about $5 million to $6 million that hit us in Q4. So, that should not repeat at those same levels in Q1 and beyond.
Harsh Kumar -- Piper Jaffray -- Analyst
Thanks.

And that concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back to Mr. Daly for closing remarks.
Steve Daly -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you. In closing, Jack and I would like to thank our employees for their efforts throughout the past quarter in the last fiscal year. We have a talented management team, a world-class employee base, and together, I'm confident we can achieve our objectives. Thank you.

Welcome to MACOM's fourth fiscal quarter 2019 earnings call on November 12, 2019. Participants are in a listen-only mode.

Steve Ferranti, Vice President of Investor Relations:
Thanks for joining MACOM's earnings call. Forward-looking statements during this call are subject to risks and uncertainties. Non-GAAP financial information will also be discussed.

Steve Daly, President and CEO:
Q4 revenue was $112.2 million with $0.01 per diluted share. We've undergone major restructuring to achieve non-GAAP profitability. Post-restructuring, we revamped organizational structures and incorporated a new organization emphasizing streamlined decision-making and accountability, emphasizing product development and execution efficiency. Core market revenues: industrial and defense at $50.1 million, data center at $22.6 million, and telecom at $39.6 million. Geographic revenue was split nearly evenly between domestic (48%) and international (52%) customers. We anticipate better cash flow management and customer satisfaction going forward. Our fiscal-year 2020 plan focuses on long-term growth and profitability.

John Kober, CFO:
Q4 saw a return to non-GAAP profitability. Year-over-year, Q4 revenue decreased mainly due to softness in data center demand and a decline in PON sales. However, restructuring led to a $50 million annualized savings target by FY Q2 2020. Adjusted operating income was $8.5 million (7.6% margin). Going forward, we expect positive operating cash flow bolstered by strict capital and expense management. We've recalibrated our accounting practices related to revenue reporting to better align with industry standards.

Q&A Highlights:
- Growth across end markets is anticipated, driven by product development and execution, particularly in data center and telecom, fueled by 5G developments.
- Long-term projects include technologies like GaN-on-Silicon, silicon photonics, and PAM4 DSPs.
- Positive momentum heading into FY 2020 is expected, supported by clear strategic priorities and operational plans.

Steve Daly closes the call thanking MACOM employees for their dedication and expressing confidence in achieving further company objectives.",301,"Operator: Welcome MACOM's fourth fiscal quarter 2019 earnings call November 12, 2019.

Operator
Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Coherent Corp. FY '23 second-quarter earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode.
After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mary Jane Raymond, chief financial officer. Please go ahead.
Mary Jane Raymond -- Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, Kevin, and good morning. I'm Mary Jane Raymond, the chief financial officer here at Coherent Corp. Welcome to our earnings call today for the second quarter of fiscal year 2023. This call is being recorded on Wednesday, February 8th, 2023.
With me today on the call is Dr. Chuck Mattera, our chair and chief executive officer. After our prepared remarks, both Dr. Giovanni Barbarossa, our chief strategy officer and the president of the materials segment; and Dr.
Mark Sobey, the president of the laser segment, will join us during the Q&A to discuss the unique benefits of our strategy, our results, and the exciting prospects across several broad markets. For today's call, the press release and the investor presentation are available in the Investor Relations section of our website, coherent.com. Today's results include certain non-GAAP measures. Non-GAAP financials are not a substitute for, nor are they superior to financials prepared in accordance with GAAP.
A detailed reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to our GAAP results is included in today's documents. I remind you that during this call, we'll make certain forward-looking statements. These include, but are not limited to, statements regarding geopolitical and macroeconomic trends, expectations for our revenue, our market trends, and our expected financial performance, including our guidance. In addition, we'll discuss our progress on integration, including our delivery of the projected synergies.
All forward-looking statements are based on today's expectations, forecasts, and assumptions. They involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our comments today. Our comments should be viewed in the context of the risk factors detailed in our most recent Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. Coherent assumes no obligation to update the information discussed during the call, except as required by law.
With that, let me turn it over to Dr. Chuck Mattera. Chuck? 
Chuck Mattera -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Mary Jane. Thank you all for joining us today. Coherent Corp. posted a record revenue quarter of 1.37 billion, consistent with the midpoint of our guidance, and grew 70% year over year and 2% sequentially.
Looking close up at legacy II-VI. Impressively, organic growth was 23% year over year and 4% sequentially, while the consolidated pro forma growth was 15% year over year. Regarding the composition of our sales by the four major markets: industrial accounted for 33%, communications 44%, 15% from electronics, and 9% from instrumentation. Turning to the distribution of our revenues by region.
The second quarter was similar to the first quarter. North America accounted for 55%; Europe, 18%; Korea and Japan combined were 13%; China was 11%; and 3% to the rest of the world. Our non-GAAP EPS was $0.95. We continued our disciplined approach to capital allocation during the quarter.
We generated 220 million in cash from operations and invested 106 million in capital equipment for 114 million in free cash flow. We also paid off 133 million of the debt. Our investments in our silicon carbide platform were nearly half of our total capital investment as we execute our multiyear road map for the electrification of transportation and renewable energy infrastructure among our commitments to sustainability. Last week, during Photonics West, we had a strong showing of our broad portfolio of new products and technology innovations that are enabling a wide range of applications across our four end markets.
Our thought leaders presented at various events, workshops, and technical sessions, and we had several significant new product announcements. These included the introduction of Python, our next-generation OLED-annealing solid-state laser targeted at new Gen 8 OLED fabs. This is the culmination of four years of innovation and development that retained Coherent's position as the annealing process of record while improving performance and significantly reducing cost per panel. We believe our innovations in this system will drive adoption into more price-sensitive displays, such as tablets, laptops, and high-end monitors.
To further secure our position as an industry leader in ultrafast cutting of OLED panels, we introduced two new ultrafast lasers. We also introduced our next-generation pump laser diodes for fiber lasers with the first semiconductor chip in the industry, to our knowledge, to achieve 50 watts of output power. And we showcased our fully automated contactless laser system for texturing and marketing implantable medical devices. Turning now to our performance by market.
Our revenue in electronics grew 131% year over year and 11% sequentially, setting another record by hitting the $200 million quarterly mark. Growth was driven primarily from sensing and the seasonal tailwinds of a new product cycle, which we described on our last call. This is the second of the seasonally high two quarters, and in the second half of the fiscal year, we will enter the seasonally low period, during which we expect to have considerably lower revenue when compared to the first half. Our customer intimacy in this market gives us optimism that the future opportunity in consumer electronics is still much broader than just VCSELs for 3D sensing.
We believe that sensing will become ubiquitous in metaverse hardware and wearables and LiDAR and other emerging applications. Our strategic engagements are growing across them all. For our silicon carbide power electronics and wireless semiconductor business, we continue to invest in silicon carbide substrate and epitaxial capacity to accelerate the pace of our shipments as demand continues to exceed our ability to supply. In the electric vehicle market, EVs represented 10% of all vehicles sold globally in calendar year 2022.
As EVs continue to grow, industry estimates expect the adoption of silicon carbide electronics will also grow but at twice the rate of the overall EV market. We are steadily gaining share in what we believe will be an underserved market for many years to come, perhaps even through the end of this decade. Communications revenue grew 18% year over year and 3% sequentially, led by both telecom and datacom, each of which achieved record revenue. Telecom growth was led by broadband initiatives, which in turn drove demand in the metro edge to access networks.
We are encouraged by the opportunity that we expect to result from the U.S.' planned $65 billion investment in broadband access from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. We expect that it will be a major catalyst for optical communications and specifically our telecom business at all levels of the value chain. As access networks grow, they drive upgrades in the metro, long-haul and submarine networks, all requiring our Coherent transceivers and ROADM integrated product solutions. Our datacom business also hit a quarterly record.
Our industry-leading position in 200G and above remains strong at 51% of our datacom transceiver business, compared to 33% a year ago. Our leadership in this area stems in part from our vertical integration of our high-speed lasers, optics, and electronics in our transceiver modules. In addition to our growth of 200G, 400G datacom transceivers, we continue to see accelerated deployments of 800G transceivers, enabling open AI and machine learning applications. We are ramping our full capacity to meet the growing customer demand over the next few quarters.
Our optical communications business was honored yesterday ahead of the Optical Fiber Conference in March with awards for three of our products that the 2023 Lightwave Innovation Review singled out. First, our 100G ZR QSFP28, which will enable service providers to upgrade millions of 10G Ethernet links to 100G at the optical network edge; second, our 200G indium phosphide electroabsorption-modulated laser, which is critical for next-generation data center interconnects; and third, our Wavemaker 4000 programmable optical spectrum synthesizer. These awards showcase our innovation leadership across our broad optical communications portfolio. Revenue into the industrial market was mixed.
EUV grew 38% year over year. Also, we achieved record revenues from products related to precision manufacturing of electric vehicle batteries. In flat panel displays, one less large Excimer line beam system shipment accounted for almost all of the quarterly change in the laser segment revenues. We saw sequential declines in the advanced packaging and interconnect markets, such as printed circuit board via hole drilling and back-end semiconductor applications such as marking.
This was offset, however, by strength in the semiconductor front end where we set another quarterly record for shipments of lasers for wafer inspection, as well as wafer annealing for logic devices. We also delivered the first full laser and optics subsystem to an industry leader for an exciting new memory application, which had previously been a nonlaser-based solution. We had a record quarter for our advanced materials and metal matrix composites into the front end of the semicap equipment market. These novel materials allow customers to push the performance limits of their wafer fab equipment, including for immersion and EUV lithography and for wafer stages and wafer chucks.
We've worked hard throughout the last few years to scale our capacity and our output to allow our customers to mitigate the semiconductor shortages by increasing tool capacity. So, we were delighted to be recognized by Applied Materials, the world's leader in wafer fab equipment, with their Supplier Excellence Award for a collaboration. We also had record Excimer laser revenues for a pulse laser deposition equipment, a rapidly growing product line serving the semicap equipment market. Customers are leveraging this new enabling technology for diverse applications from high-temperature superconducting tape for next-generation fusion reactors to 5G filters in mobile phones.
We are a market leader and a pioneer in pulse laser deposition. This technology has the promise of enabling the production of novel semiconductor materials through the engineering of atoms and photons, a great example of the synergistic power of our combinations. Our instrumentation business sustained record levels, growing 2% sequentially. While PCR-based COVID testing is tapering off, our growth in bioinstrumentation from other applications allowed this market to maintain the higher level of revenue achieved during the growth for PCR testing.
We also had strong revenue for our products in advanced imaging applications for neuroscience and disease studies. These applications require ultra-short pulsed lasers, part of our portfolio where we excel. Before I turn it over to Mary Jane, I imagine that you all have now seen our other exciting news today: our move to list our stock on the New York Stock Exchange on February 23rd. Nasdaq has served us well since our IPO on October 2nd, 1987, and we are very appreciative of that support.
With our recent growth, our continuing aspirations to be the best at what we do and our global platform, we believe that the New York Stock Exchange complements our new Coherent brand and is the right place for us to be at this time alongside many of the world's most prestigious companies. With that, I'll turn it over to Mary Jane. Mary Jane?
Mary Jane Raymond -- Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, Chuck. Our revenue of $1.37 billion was negatively affected by 6 million from currency compared to Q1 FY '23 with immaterial effects on the EPS. Our backlog was 2.9 billion at 12/31 and remains solid as customers return to more normal patterns of ordering and inventory management. Our Q2 non-GAAP gross margin was 39.8%, and the non-GAAP operating margin was 20.3%, both negatively affected by $3 million in currency or 20 basis points compared to Q1. Supply chain costs were $10 million and are not excluded to arrive at the non-GAAP results.
At the segment level, the non-GAAP operating margins were 19.4% for networking and 26.2% for materials and 15.7% for lasers. GAAP operating expenses, SG&A plus R&D, were $403 million in Q2. Excluding $90 million of amortization, 29 million of stock comp, and $16 million of transaction and integration costs, non-GAAP opex was $268 million, or 19.6% of revenue. Our total stock comp is expected to be 30 million to 32 million per quarter for each of Q3 and Q4.
Synergies have now reached $30 million on an annualized basis, and we are making good progress in all categories. Quarterly GAAP EPS was a loss of $0.58, and non-GAAP EPS was $0.95 with after tax non-GAAP adjustments of $217 million in total. The diluted share count for the GAAP results was 139 million shares. And for the non-GAAP results, the share count was 150 million shares.
The GAAP and non-GAAP EPS calculations are on Tables 6 and 7 of our press release. Interest expense in the quarter was $71 million and for the six months ended December 31st, interest expense was 132 million. Our original outlook for interest cost in August was $274 million on the basis of the one-month LIBOR reaching 4.2%. It is now forecast on the yield curve to achieve 5.1%.
Should that happen on the schedule expected, our goal, along with our debt repayments, will be to limit the change in our initial estimate to $5 million to $7 million for a total of $279 million to $281 million. Our December 31st balance of cash items was $913 million, an increase from the prior quarter of 15 million. After paying down 133 million of debt in Q2, our total debt position on December 31st was 4.6 billion. Using the trailing 12 months of adjusted EBITDA on a pro forma basis for the combined company at December 31, the gross leverage was 3.6 times, and the net leverage was 2.9 times without the synergy credit.
Including the synergy credit of 235 million that is allowed by our credit facility definition, the gross leverage is 3 times and the net leverage is 2.4 times. Note that 15 million of synergies are already in the results. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 32%. The non-GAAP tax rate is 19%.
We expect the tax rate for the remainder of fiscal year '23 to be between 18% and 22%, assuming the current mix of earnings, and no adoption of new or additional tax rulings. Returning to -- turning to the outlook for Q3 fiscal year '23. Our outlook for revenue for the third fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2023, is expected to be $1.32 billion to $1.37 billion and earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis to be $0.75 to $0.90 per share. With respect to our expectations on full-year revenue, we expect revenue to range from $5.35 billion to $5.55 billion.
Our non-GAAP EPS estimate assumes the effects of purchase accounting, which are all still preliminary, will be added back to GAAP EPS other than the depreciation that is about $5 million in Q3. The share count is 152 million shares for the entire guidance range. The EPS calculation, including the dividend treatment, is detailed on Table 8 of the press release for the guidance range. This table also shows the earnings at which the Series B preferred stock is dilutive.
All of the foregoing is at today's exchange rates at an estimated tax rate of 19%. For the non-GAAP earnings per share, we add back to the GAAP earnings pre-tax amounts of $140 million to $145 million, consisting of 95 million in amortization, 30 million in stock compensation, and 15 million to 20 million for transaction integration and restructuring. The actual dollar amount of non-GAAP items, the tax rate, the exchange rates, the purchase price accounting, and the share counts are all subject to change. As a reminder, our answers today during the Q&A may contain forecasts from which our actual results may differ for a variety of factors.
These include changes in the mix, customer requirements, supply chain availability, competition, and economic conditions. With that, Kevin, you may open the line for questions.
Questions & Answers:
Operator
[Operator instructions] We will pause for a moment while we can pull our Q&A roster. First question comes from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Your line is open.
Ananda Baruah -- Loop Capital Markets -- Analyst
Yeah. Good morning, guys. Yeah. Congrats on solid results and ongoing strong execution.
Thanks for taking the questions. Two quick ones if I could. Chuck, are you seeing any, I guess, what you would consider to be meaningful softening in any of the businesses -- in any of the meaningful businesses? And then could you give us an update on supply constraints? And then I have a quick follow-up. Thanks.
Chuck Mattera -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
OK. Well, Ananda, thanks for your question. Let's take the supply chain first. In the second quarter, the supply chain constraints affected us to a level of $67 million.
And so, that will give you some sense. It's considerably lower than it was a couple of quarters ago. It's definitely getting better, but it did have an impact on us. That's first.
Second, I tried to give you the color -- all the color we could about the markets, about the regions, about the products in our prepared comments. And I would say from the last 90 days, if you look at our revenue guidance, the only thing that you can see which is different is that we have a greater confidence on picking up the bottom end of that revenue guidance, and we shaved just a little bit off the top end. And all of that takes into account our best judgments today. And wherever there are small pockets or pockets of slowdown, we have the versatility, the resiliency, the backlog, and the determination to blow past them.
OK?
Ananda Baruah -- Loop Capital Markets -- Analyst
That's very helpful. And as a follow-up, would just love to get a sense where you guys believe legacy Coherent is in the display business cycle. And that's it for me. Thanks.
Chuck Mattera -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
OK. I'll ask Mark to take that one.
Mark Sobey -- President, Laser Segment
Hi. Thanks for the question. I think as we discussed in our prior call in November, the Excimer annealing business, represents between 20% and 25% of our quarterly revenue, and we're still very much in that phase. So, I think the forward-looking growth opportunity that we see in IT displays, specifically tablets and laptops, is in front of us, probably one to two years out.
But we're in a pretty steady phase.
Ananda Baruah -- Loop Capital Markets -- Analyst
Very helpful. Thanks a lot, guys.
Operator
One moment for our next question. Next question comes from Simon Leopold of Raymond James. Your line is open.
Simon Leopold -- Raymond James -- Analyst
Thank you very much for taking the question. I appreciate the details today. I wanted to see if we could dig into your updates on your exposure to the hyperscalers or webscalers. I'm estimating that they're probably close to 10% of total revenue, maybe a little bit below that, following the integration with the old Coherent.
But given some of the capital spending trends, I'm wondering if you can update us on your thoughts of how much of your business is coming from there and what your expectations are for the balance of calendar '23. Thank you.
Chuck Mattera -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Simon. I'm going to ask Giovanni to address your question. Thanks for your question.
Giovanni Barbarossa -- Chief Strategy Officer and President, Materials Segment
Thanks, Chuck, and thanks, Simon, for the question. So the -- of course, it does change the percentage of the exposure to hyperscalers quarter-by-quarter. But roughly right, it's about 30% of the total. We said this in the past, it's about, let's say, 30% hyperscalers, 30% what we call cloud, about maybe a group of 30 customers.
And then a long tail does the rest, the rest of the 30%. So, we have not really seen any slowdown whatsoever in the -- at least for the second half of the year. We don't really see any slowdown in demand. That could be explained by a number of factors.
I probably -- one is the fact that the higher-speed products, let's say, 200G and above, now almost they represents 50% of our total. OK? So, that's where most of the investments are growing. Particularly, of course, with the hyperscalers, we tend to innovate and introduce higher data rates and obviously the general cloud or even the long term of the customers. So, that's one reason.
The other one, as I said earlier in previous quarters, we see still an opportunity to regain share that we think the -- we lost over the past, let's say, 3 years between the transition from Finisar to II-VI and now Coherent. So, we -- there's still pockets of markets we think we can to continue to grow our share. So, the two combined explains why we don't see any slowdown. If anything, we're very -- we're quite bullish about the near-term future.
Simon Leopold -- Raymond James -- Analyst
And just a quick clarification, that 30% value you referenced is 30% of your networking segment?
Giovanni Barbarossa -- Chief Strategy Officer and President, Materials Segment
No. 30% of the datacom.
Simon Leopold -- Raymond James -- Analyst
30% of datacom. And what's that as a percent of networking?
Giovanni Barbarossa -- Chief Strategy Officer and President, Materials Segment
OK. So, that's 30% of 50%. So, it will be like 15%.
Simon Leopold -- Raymond James -- Analyst
Thank you very much. Appreciate it.

Our next question comes from James Ricchiuti with Needham. Your line is open.
Jim Ricchiuti -- Needham and Company -- Analyst
Just wanted to talk a little bit more about the laser business in that we saw a step down in laser operating margins. I was hoping you can give a little bit more color around what's contributed to that.
Chuck Mattera -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Mary Jane, do you want to take it first?
Mary Jane Raymond -- Chief Financial Officer
Sure. Generally speaking, what affects any of our segments on the margin is that -- we -- I would say that that is probably a little bit more pronounced in the laser segment, but it's generally true across all the segments.
Jim Ricchiuti -- Needham and Company -- Analyst
And the line being that you alluded to that contributed to some of the mixed results in industrial, is that a case where that ELA tool is slipping a quarter, or is that potentially going out a little further? And maybe what contributed to that? Is that just customer site not being ready, or is there some change in potentially seeing some signs of changing demand in the display market near term?
Mark Sobey -- President, Laser Segment
Jim, this is Mark. That's a good question. It wasn't actually -- it wasn't a pushout. We knew we were anticipating to ship one large landing system last [Inaudible] during the quarter.
So, there was no -- it was really based on customer demand, and so no change there. We had anticipated being able to offset with some other upside business, but as you heard, we still had some supply chain balances that affected some of our other business.
Jim Ricchiuti -- Needham and Company -- Analyst

Our next question comes from Dave Kang with B. Riley. Your line is open.
Dave Kang -- B. Riley Financial -- Analyst
Thank you. Good morning. Just wanted to clarify about your comment -- Giovanni, your comments about telecom versus datacom. So, it's 50-50 between telecom and datacom, is that what you said about Simon's question?
Giovanni Barbarossa -- Chief Strategy Officer and President, Materials Segment
Yes. I'd say it's about -- to be accurate, it's 54-46. So, 54% telecom, 46% telecom.
Dave Kang -- B. Riley Financial -- Analyst
OK. Got it. And then my question is on the backlog. So, it was down a little bit from $3.05 billion to $2.9 billion.
Just wondering if sort of backlog apparently peaked already. If you can talk about the expected decay rate, when does it normalize? And also, can you provide the composition of the backlog?
Mary Jane Raymond -- Chief Financial Officer
So, we don't normally give the composition of the backlog, number one. But two, Dave, you may remember on the last call as well as in various conferences, one of the things that I noted was that investors should not be worried if the backlog starts to go down, we don't necessarily consider it a decay because the goal was to start to ship what's in that backlog. So, we are seeing customers returning to more normal patterns of ordering, and that's exactly the behavior we saw in the second quarter was exactly what we expected.
Chuck Mattera -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
And I would add, Mary Jane -- I would add, Dave, I think that asset to normal ordering patterns will take place over the next few quarters.
Dave Kang -- B. Riley Financial -- Analyst
Got it. And my follow-up is, Chuck, your commentary about deceleration in some of the -- your end markets. Just wondering if you can specify which end markets are decelerating or expected to decelerate.
Chuck Mattera -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Dave. I would point to the industrial section in my comments about the back end of the line for the semiconductor equipment. Like that gave you some sense for a little bit of a slowdown as it relates to lasers for via-hole drilling and for marking. And I also balance that with the really substantial growth that we've seen both in EUV, on the industrial side and battery welding on the industrial side.
And then, also, in our materials for front end of the line equipment in semicap. So, it's a mix, and I said so, that's probably the best example.
Dave Kang -- B. Riley Financial -- Analyst
So, just to be clear, you're not throwing in the sensing segment as part of the segment that is slowing?
Chuck Mattera -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
I also -- in my commentary, Dave, I also pointed to the fact that in the first two quarters of our fiscal year, we have seasonal tailwinds. And I also made a clear remark about the second half of the year that we expect to be considerably lower than the first half. OK?
Dave Kang -- B. Riley Financial -- Analyst
But just because of the seasonality, not necessarily the weaker demand, right?
Chuck Mattera -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Giovanni, do you want to elaborate on that?
Giovanni Barbarossa -- Chief Strategy Officer and President, Materials Segment
Yes. Sure, Chuck. Dave, of course, the demand is not something that we have seen slowing down. There's -- that's why we talk about seasonality.
Seasonality, it's all about introduction of new products from our customers, and we follow the pattern. So, it's completely unrelated to demand.
Dave Kang -- B. Riley Financial -- Analyst
Got it. Thank you.

Our next question comes from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Samik Chatterjee -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst
Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I have a couple. Maybe if I can start with a question on backlog.
And totally understand your sort of view in terms of the backlog will start to moderate a bit as supply improves and order patterns normalize. How are you thinking about backlog related to sort of exiting the year? Does this remain elevated? And just trying to match that up against sort of the decision to take some of the high end of the revenue guide a touch lower. I mean, how does that sort of match up with the backlog still remaining quite high at this point? And I have a follow-up.
Mary Jane Raymond -- Chief Financial Officer
First of all, I'd say --
Chuck Mattera -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Mary Jane?
Mary Jane Raymond -- Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. Sure, Chuck. Thanks. I would say that, on the one hand, while not necessarily, I know we only have a half to go here forecasting the backlog.
Last quarter, I had indicated if we saw a resting backlog over time, not necessarily by 6/30 but over time, coming down more toward 2.5, 2.6, I wouldn't be surprised. But I don't necessarily think it will be at that level by 6/30. So, that's the first thing. I would say they're probably, really in some ways, unrelated to each other.
We just -- the backlog does remain very high. But do keep in mind that, that backlog is over 12 months. And as we've indicated in the past, typically, the individual items that are in the backlog are timed. They may not necessarily all be times to being shipped by 6/30.
So, we have some customers who routinely will give us relatively long-dated orders going across the entire 12 months. So, it really has nothing so much to do with the backlog coming down a little bit, the change in the top end. It's just more truing up the forecast as we've gone along here.
Samik Chatterjee -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst
Got it. And for my follow-up, I think, Chuck and Mary Jane, you both talked about sort of the mix in -- mixed sort of end-market outlook that you're seeing with certain markets remaining very strong, certain sort of pockets of weakness. If we aggregate all that together, like how is the book-to-bill looking, particularly as you sort of go through the last few months of the quarter? Like are we continuing to see sort of a step down in the aggregate book-to-bill? Or is that because of the diversification that you have remaining quite robust?
Mary Jane Raymond -- Chief Financial Officer
Well, again, the book-to-bill is not nearly as relevant really right now as the backlog itself. I mean, customers are changing their ordering patterns. But, generally, I would say there are variations certainly in bookings in particular areas where customers have had given much, much longer-dated orders in now, say, 12 months when their historical ordering pattern is more like six, so they're returning to six. But generally speaking, I would say that we're very, very positive about the outlook for the company given the strength of that backlog.
Chuck, would you like to add anything to that?
Chuck Mattera -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
No. I think what we said stands. Over the next few quarters, we can expect it to -- the book-to-bill ratio as we see it to get to more normal patterns that we would have seen before the last couple of years' events, including where the supply chain shortages started.
Samik Chatterjee -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst

Our next question comes from Mark Miller with The Benchmark Company. Your line is open.
Mark Miller -- The Benchmark Company -- Analyst
Thank you for the question. I just wanted to talk about -- you said that the supply constraints again impacted sales by 67 million. I'm wondering how that broke out between networking and lasers.
Chuck Mattera -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
It was mostly networking -- thanks for your question, by the way. Good Morning, Mark. It was -- yes, it was nearly all networking, but there was an impact to the lasers segment.
Mark Miller -- The Benchmark Company -- Analyst
I just was wondering in terms of other expense, it's jumped around the last couple of quarters. Do we expect other expense in the March quarter to be similar to what you saw in December?
Mary Jane Raymond -- Chief Financial Officer
I would say that it's probably going to be somewhat lower, probably closer to plus or minus $1 million. It does move around for an awful lot of things, some of which are still related to purchase accounting. But it's probably for Q3, plus or minus $1 million.
Mark Miller -- The Benchmark Company -- Analyst

Our next question comes from Jed Dorsheimer with William Blair. Your line is open.
Jed Dorsheimer -- William Blair and Company -- Analyst
Hi. Thanks. And thanks for taking my questions. I just have one and a follow-up.
I guess, Mary Jane or Chuck, did I hear correctly from a capex split, the 50% was going to silicon carbide? Could you just clarify that for me?
Mary Jane Raymond -- Chief Financial Officer
Probably in the neighborhood of 35% to 50% is going into silicon carbide. It's a significant part of our capex for the year.
Jed Dorsheimer -- William Blair and Company -- Analyst
Got it. And then I didn't hear you talk much -- and maybe I've missed this, but it seems like you have a truly differentiated position with high-quality 200-millimeter, whereas rest of the market is struggling with 150 other than one other competitors. So, I'm just curious if you could elaborate on sort of what you have that may be different or the -- without getting into process, etc., that I'm sure you wouldn't be entering. But just what would you like to say about sort of the strategy around 200.
And I think in your recent presentation, you even talked about getting to 300-millimeter.
Chuck Mattera -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
OK. Good morning, Jed. Thanks for your question. Jed, just quickly, and at a very high level that's all that's required, we have designed a process technology for growing substrates -- silicon carbide substrates around a set of materials and equipment, which we design in-house.
Our equipment, crystal growth equipment, allows us to scale such that we can grow 200-millimeter substrates in the same equipment that we grow 150. We announced in 2015 the first high-quality 200-millimeter silicon carbide substrates introduced to the marketplace. That's eight years ago. So, I would say the one thing that we have is proprietary advantage, second is a scalable platform, third is nearly 10 years of experience.
And we are dedicating some part of our capacity today, which is overwhelmingly in demand for 150-millimeter substrates. We are still dedicating capacity to improve and scale and position us for the 200-millimeter market. So, it's not a question of technology. It's really a question of capacity.
And our investments in even more capital, again, another tranche later this year and then again next year, we'll have both the market opportunity and the market demand in front of us both for 150 and 200. OK?
Jed Dorsheimer -- William Blair and Company -- Analyst

Next question comes from Richard Shannon with Craig-Hallum. Your line is open.
Richard Shannon -- Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- Analyst
Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe kind of a two-parter here in your broader sensing category. I guess, the first part of this is, Chuck or Giovanni, how do you see the share position with the kind of 3D sensing when you get into the next generation? Do you see an upward or downward bias to that? And then maybe can you paint us a bigger picture on the broader sensing category outside of 3D sensing? How do you see this ramping applications and kind of the thought process and time frame when that becomes a lot bigger than it is today?
Giovanni Barbarossa -- Chief Strategy Officer and President, Materials Segment
Hi, Richard. Thanks for your question. So, I think it's hard to exactly measure the share. We think that we've been growing our share, generally speaking.
And due to -- thanks to the level of [Inaudible] integration, which we think is still unique, let alone the scale that we have, so this has been very, very favorable to our ability to be very competitive, scale-wise, cost-wise, and most importantly, quality-wise. And we think that we have reached a point where we believe we are the share leader in many ways. And so we have a number of opportunities in front of us for new designs, new applications, new markets, new -- also new technologies that should be able to let us continue to enjoy this share leadership, not only in 3D but also, as I said, in optical sensing, particularly optical sensing enabled by semiconductor lasers. So, there's a number of new applications emerging, which we are working on.
You know, all of them, they are all obviously applied in many ways. And we can't really talk about all the details. But we think we are very well positioned to continue to enjoy a very close partnership and with our key customers, generally speaking.
Richard Shannon -- Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- Analyst
OK. Fair enough. Thanks for all the details, Giovanni. A follow-up on a specific topic within datacom.
You've talked about in the last few conference calls about 800 gig here. I guess it's probably my assumption, I think most people would assume that's a very small piece of your datacom business. Maybe you can just verify that's still the case or kind of give us a sense of where it's at. But I think the bigger question here is thinking about share in that category.
I think you've had to battle back from a disappointing start in the 100-, 200- to 400-gig generation. But where do you sit in 800 gig? And when does that become a more noticeable part of your business? Is that -- will that happen this calendar year, or is it more of a '24 story? Thanks.
Giovanni Barbarossa -- Chief Strategy Officer and President, Materials Segment
Yes. Thanks, Richard. Well, 800G is very early, as you know. It's still small compared to lower data rates.
But we are shipping 800G today. We think we are very competitive solution. Thanks to -- as you know, the integration of our electronics, photonics, and all the assembly and automation that we have, we have -- we think we have the most competitive platform out there. And it's definitely not going to -- something that's going to be material this fiscal year.
But next year, we'll ramp up very rapidly. And I think we're well positioned, as we've been in the past, to support the demand primarily -- as we said earlier, primarily for hyperscalers. So, we have -- I think we are very well positioned to get the larger share of the market there.
Richard Shannon -- Craig-Hallum Capital Group -- Analyst
Great. Thanks, guys. That's all for me.

Our next question comes from Tim Savageaux with Northland Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Tim Savageaux -- Northland Securities -- Analyst
Hi, good morning. Wanted to talk about kind of overall growth expectations heading forward and specifically, in fiscal '24 and moving forward. I think you've talked in the past about expectations for a double-digit growth rate for Coherent. I wonder, given some of the macro stuff that you're seeing, whether that remains the case or if you can give us any color on that.
And then along with that, as you look at your major segments across networking materials and lasers, how do you expect those three to contribute to the baseline of growth that you're expecting? Thanks.
Chuck Mattera -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Hey, Tim. Good morning. Thanks for your question. Tim, we are determined to continue this leadership position in the market.
We have another few months to play out as it relates to collecting up the new orders working on the backlog, positioning the portfolio. So, we're not going to give an FY '24 guidance today, but we are determined to outpace the growth of the market. And even with some of these pockets of softness, we have to determine whether or not we're looking at a one-quarter or a two-quarter effect. And we're intensely engaged with customers now.
So, I would say we're enthusiastic. We're making all the right bets in all the right places. We're taking full steps and making good progress even with new customers as we try to stitch together the advantages of, for example, the materials in the lasers portfolio. And it's coming along.
So, I would just leave it at, yes, it's true that our aspiration is to grow double digit into '24, but it's going to take us another few months to sort through that. And we'll provide an update over the course of the next 90 days, probably as we head into May and then possibly into August. OK?
Tim Savageaux -- Northland Securities -- Analyst
Great. Sorry, if I can follow up real quick, and I appreciate that answer. On the telecom side, you seem to put up some pretty good sequential growth there. I imagine a lot of that is driven by supply improvement.
But are there any particular product categories within telecom where you saw either strong demand or improved supply to drive that sequential growth? Thanks.
Chuck Mattera -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Tim, thanks. I'll take that one, too. I think you hit on all of them. It really was a nice mix we have had and have a good backlog.
That's true. Parts of the supply chain constraints were broken. That's true. And we do have demand across the entire telecom portfolio, Coherent transceivers, wavelength selective switches and the ROADMs, all three.
So, it's just a question of timing -- order timing and then execution of the -- through the operations, taking into account improvements, and in some cases, not so much improvement in the supply chain situation. That did hold us back somewhat on telecom again this quarter.
Tim Savageaux -- Northland Securities -- Analyst

Our next question comes from Paul Silverstein with Cowen. Your line is open.
Paul Silverstein -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst
Good morning, guys. I apologize to you and others on the call if these were already asked and answered. My line dropped. First off, I assume your previously stated 38% to 42% range but goal maintaining over 40% gross margin hasn't changed.
And, Mary Jane, any color you can provide us as to the various positive and negative levers? And I think last quarter, you cited an $8 million FX impact on gross margin. I may have that wrong, but did you mention any appreciable FX impact this quarter?
Mary Jane Raymond -- Chief Financial Officer
So, a couple of things. One, our range on the gross margin has not changed. The effects on the margin last quarter, I think, was $6 million positive. This quarter, it was $3 million negative.
So, the currency is -- there's a little havoc being played with the currencies, which is a little bit challenging. And, secondly, our cost to obtain short supply parts also increased a little bit. But having said that, it is still absolutely the company's goal to continue to push this gross margin. And, absolutely, every operating leader in our company both knows that and is behaving as a very great partner in helping to make that happen.
Paul Silverstein -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst
Mary Jane, I think virtually every company in this earnings cycle has cited ongoing supply chain challenges, but visibility as to improvement with quite a number indicating that the tougher before resolution calendar '23. Any thoughts you can share on that? And then I've got one quick follow-up.
Mary Jane Raymond -- Chief Financial Officer
I think, based on what our guy is saying, too, that it's actually a fairly decent chance that by the time we get to what would be our fiscal year '24, which is the back half of '23, that we may start to see most of the issues behind us. So, I think we still have a quarter or so to go here on it. But I do think probably by the end of the year, if not the 9/30 quarter, we should see that starting to get behind us.
Paul Silverstein -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst
OK. And I appreciate the more challenging macro environment. I know it's still precisely early with respect to the Coherent acquisition. But are there any early data points as revenue synergies with Coherent? And perhaps, Chuck, Giovanni, Mary Jane, you all could compare it to our progress with Finisar.
If I recall, I think it was within three quarters of the close of that deal that you got that Sherman facility qualified and up and shipping on the VCSELs. I think at the time, Finisar had little, if any, presence with hyperscalers. And I think you now have 3 of the big 4, and you just said it's 30% of your datacom, 15% of comms revenue. Any early signs of that nature that would speak to enhancement of Coherent's competitive position and wallet share with customers?
Chuck Mattera -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Paul, for your question. I'll go first and if Mary Jane or Giovanni like to -- or Mark would like to add, they can. I think as it relates to your question regarding revenue synergies, it's clear that, of course, there are revenue synergies that don't exist in the networking business. But across industrial, life sciences, semicap equipment, and our aerospace and defense business, there are those opportunities.
And between the key account managers, between the strategic marketing team and the product managers, especially in the businesses that Giovanni and Mark lead, there are lots of engagements that are happening, including driven by our customers themselves who are desiring to pull us together to understand how the combined portfolio can help them enable yet another disruption. So, those conversations are happening and the markets that I just described to the markets that we're focused on. And, Giovanni, would you like to add anything or Mark?
Giovanni Barbarossa -- Chief Strategy Officer and President, Materials Segment
No. Chuck, I think you summarized it well. There is no doubt, it's a very synergistic deal combination to begin with, which we really used to explain the rationale of the combination since the beginning across those four verticals that Chuck mentioned. So, I think it's -- every day is a learning opportunity for us to really figure out substantially more synergies than we ever thought during due diligence just because we were somehow limited by our relative antitrust lawyers to really talk too much about it.
And so, now, we are discovering the incredible set of combinations that we can leverage to grow the business even more.
Mark Sobey -- President, Laser Segment
Chuck, I would just add -- it's a great question, actually. I'd just add, just specifically in our instrumentation space to use that as a really easy example, our two leading customers that we typically engage with both companies separately prior to the acquisition. We might get an audience, maybe 10 or 15 people and maybe some vice presidents. And we recently at Photonics West show had meetings with two of our leading instrumentation customers with over 40 participants from each of the customers.
And we essentially got executive suite attendees there that we would previously have not done. And I think several of our customers have commented that they like the fact that they see as much more as a strategic partner rather than just maybe a leading vendor. So, I think we've got early indications in multiple markets and in multiple spaces. But that's just an easy example based Photonics West in the last few weeks.

Our next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Vivek Arya -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst
Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to revisit your silicon carbide opportunity. First, with -- how much did silicon carbide contribute by way of sales for the December quarter? How much did it grow year on year? And how do you think about the growth outlook this year?
Mary Jane Raymond -- Chief Financial Officer
Chuck, if you want to take the growth question, I'll find the other ones.
Chuck Mattera -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
OK. The revenues -- Vivek, good morning. Revenues grew about 10% or so sequentially. And Mary Jane can at least range the revenues maybe with the best view for the full year.
They are growing. We expect them to continue to grow. They're capped at the kind of band of revenue that we have today on the basis of the capacity that we have installed capacity that we have in place. That capacity is being added tranche by tranche, large numbers of furnaces at a time.
And we've given some guidance over the last couple of calls as to how we expect that to evolve. Mary Jane, do you want to give a range for revenues in the [Inaudible]
Mary Jane Raymond -- Chief Financial Officer
So, the revenue is about 3% to 4% of the total company. And if you think about that having been 5% of the previous company, which was a smaller size, it showed some very, very nice growth with, as Chuck said, 10% growth year over year. The addition of capacity is very, very essential, as Chuck just described. And we're looking forward to that coming online so that we can continue to deliver on the demand that we're right now capacity-wise for.
Vivek Arya -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst
And is there an opportunity to appeal for whether it's CHIPS Act funding or other state or federal funding? Because when I look at a number of your competitors, they are building out a lot of capacity as well. So, as much as I know you are spending a lot in your capex, half of your capex or at least a third of it is going toward this opportunity, but there is a window right now to be investing in this, assuming that this is a market that you want to be a big player in. Then why not try to spend more or try to get more funding from these government agencies, so you can really take advantage of what could be a meaningful growth area for Coherent?
Chuck Mattera -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Look, Vivek, this is a meaningful growth opportunity for us, and we couldn't be more excited about it. So, we're focused on that. That's for sure. And to your point, we are in discussions with both elected officials and with government agencies, both at the federal government level in the U.S.
and at the state level. And these discussions are ongoing and growing more intense here most recently.

Just in terms of the China reopening, just any impact or kind of step back in what you saw in terms of supply chain challenges or just production capability, demand? Just anything to kind of note there and whether you've seen kind of getting through that past any maybe COVID waves that I've passed through there. And then as a second question just for Mary Jane, any changes to kind of minimum cash that you would want to keep on hand just given macro? Or should we still consider use of cash primarily debt pay down and capex in the near term? That's it for me.
Thanks.
Chuck Mattera -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Mary Jane, I'd like -- Mary Jane, if you would, I'll go first just on the environment in China and then if you would address the financial question. Meta, I would say as it relates to this last -- let's call it, the last 60 to 90 days or so, for us, for all intents and purposes, it's pretty much the same as it's been for the last two or three years. It's been one story: resilient, flexible, agile, enthusiastic, and able to confront whatever headwinds come and let them just blow right by. The operational team and the team in China have really just done a fantastic job despite the challenges.
And they're already on to -- looking forward to the opportunity over the next few quarters or so to position our company there as best as we possibly can.
Mary Jane Raymond -- Chief Financial Officer
With respect to the cash question, I'm pretty sure you've never met a CFO that didn't want more cash. But generally speaking, there's really no change in the minimum cash we have. And as we indicated last quarter, and you just summarized very well, we have changed our thinking a little bit to include debt paydown during fiscal year '23, as well as capex priorities. That does not slow down the speed with which we're starting the synergies, and we're going to continue along that path.

Next question comes from Tom O'Malley with Barclays. Your line is open.
Tom O'Malley -- Barclays -- Analyst
Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to dive into the electronics segment here. Could you break down, within electronics, how much of that segment is 3D sensing in the December quarter? Thank you.
Mary Jane Raymond -- Chief Financial Officer
As a general matter, sensing overall, the consumer side overall is the majority of it.
Tom O'Malley -- Barclays -- Analyst
OK. And then I think Giovanni made some comments, and I think Chuck echoed them as well that on the consumer side, the second half of the year tends to be a lot weaker than the first half of the year. There's just obviously a large cyclical customer there. But when you look at your fiscal year guide, you have an acceleration in revenue to get to your full year.
Could you just talk about what other end markets are accelerating that can offset the seasonality of the electronics segment? Thank you.
Mary Jane Raymond -- Chief Financial Officer
Well, it's pretty much the same thing we've seen for the last couple of years, at least on the legacy II-VI side, which is that the fourth quarter tends to be the strongest quarter in general. It is perhaps less enormously strong than it had been prior to 3D sensing being -- or the sensing market being in the numbers. But, generally, I'd say we would expect to see kind of typical seasonality and some strengthening in the other end markets.
Giovanni Barbarossa -- Chief Strategy Officer and President, Materials Segment
Tom, this is Giovanni. Just want to add, new features, new functions, new technology gets in and out of products all the time. What we have seen is that, generally speaking, consumer automotive, general, anywhere, there is a need for interactivity with the machine. Lasers and photodiols imaging, generally speaking, a very powerful way to sense the world and provide an AI engine inside the machine to respond and make decisions.
So, that's a trend which will continue and will also increase in terms of the actual ability to, again, sense in broader terms, not only physically but also from a -- for example, from a target perspective, they need different type of sources. Depending on the application, there's a different level of power, etc. So, we have seen and you guys have seen, as the number of lasers, a number of photodiodes, the number of solution that get added to consumer electronics products. And then automotive, inside or outside the cat, it just will keep increasing.
So, it's not whether or not -- of course, there's going to be more phones, more cars sold eventually and maybe more phones. But it's even assuming that more phones have saturated as a number, we think that the adoption of this technology will continue to grow. And so, you can expect future products to be adopted to enhance the functionality of these products.
Mary Jane Raymond -- Chief Financial Officer
Also, let me just clarify something. I should have helped Chuck here more. On our silicon carbide growth, the answer is that it's 10% -- the growth is 10% year over year. And it's pretty flat sequentially for exactly the same reason Chuck gave, which is the capacity constraint.

Our next question comes from Ruben Roy with Stifel. Your line is open.
Ruben Roy -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- Analyst
Thank you. Chuck, a lot of detail so far. But if we could spend a minute on -- there's a comment in the press release around the pricing and thoughtfully increasing pricing in some areas. Obviously, the -- with the business becoming more diversified, wondering if you could just kind of maybe give us a little bit of detail around how you're seeing the pricing environment evolve, especially in the context of input costs and supply constraints improving.
And then I guess you talked about positioning the portfolio of the diversified company and how that's playing into how you're thinking about longer-term pricing strategy, that would be helpful. Thanks.
Chuck Mattera -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
OK. I'll start -- thanks for your question. I'll start, and then, I'll ask Giovanni to add on to it and provide even more color. In these last six months, we put the entire product management team of the whole combined company through a fairly rigorous training cycle.
And those product managers in conjunction with -- in connection with the global sales and service organization have had a strategic imperative to improve the operating margins and to position us for competitive pricing that reflect the true value that we bring to the marketplace. Those conversations have been going on even long before we combined with legacy Coherent, but we really stepped it up in the last six months. And whereas you'd like to do it across the board, it's not practical. And so, you have to be focused on it.
You have to have a strategy for it and an intimacy with the customers with regard to a long-range value proposition and a long-range partnership, which we always focus on developing. And, Giovanni, do you want to point out one or two examples of success in the last six to 12 months?
Giovanni Barbarossa -- Chief Strategy Officer and President, Materials Segment
Sure, Chuck. Yes, we had -- we've been quite successful in a very cooperative environment with our customers, understanding that some of our costs, particularly in those products that require transformation, so we talk about material processing, material transformation, where there is a significant amount of energy needed, we have been able to increase price in a reasonable way. And I think that the customers have been very pleased. In some cases, we have been offered price increases to -- by the customer to secure share in this kind of environment, where they realize that there could have been a risk of supply.
So, it's been a combination of us -- asking us to increase prices, which we've been quite successful with. And then, customers, in some cases, offering price increases to again continue and secure the continual supply for some of these products, which, again, have been affected by a number of inflationary effects that we all know, particularly around energy supply.

Our next question comes from Mike Genovese with Rosenblatt. Your line is open.
Mike Genovese -- Rosenblatt Securities -- Analyst
Thanks so much. Thanks for squeezing me in. First question, now that we're in the good part of the 400G data center transceiver cycle, can you talk a bit [Technical difficulty] 400G versus 100G, if it's meaningfully different? And then, importantly, is there are any technology moats that you can build in 400G versus 100G because of the greater investment needed in the technology? Thank you.
Giovanni Barbarossa -- Chief Strategy Officer and President, Materials Segment
So, first of all, just for the sake of clarity, as you know, we say 200, 400, 800, 1.6G. As far as we know, it's all about 100 gigabits per second. And then you're talking about data rates. So, we have to distinguish between -- speed and data rates are not exactly the same.
So, even at 400G may actually be four times 100. And 200, maybe two times 100. 200G, we have wireline 200G. We just announced an EML at the European conference last September.
It's best in the world, we think, and eventually will be a significant shift in bits per second, not necessarily as a data rate but as a speed. So, all of those complications of combining 100G optical lanes into 200, 400, 800, they have several solutions, several standards. It's -- we have potentially the ability to support all of those form factors, all of those data rates. And we, obviously, own a substantial vertical level -- sorry, vertical level of integration in terms of the lasers, in terms of the ICs, in terms of the optics that go into those products.
So, I wouldn't necessarily claim -- and nobody could claim that there is a strength in 400G, but there is no strength in 200G or vice versa because the strength is at the bit rate level -- sorry, the strength is at the speed level, not necessarily at a bit rate level. So, I think we are well positioned at 100G. We are already well positioned for 200G speed. And so, all of the data rates from 200G and above, I think, we're very well positioned to, again, as I said earlier, to continue to gain share in the marketplace.
We are seeing -- just to give you an -- just last year, we were at about maybe 15%, and it went to 30%. And now, we're about 50% of the total datacom sales are actually at 200G and above, which is a sign that we are really focused on the high end of the market, thanks to the -- again, the combination of the portfolio, component level that we own and we are better integrated with.
Mike Genovese -- Rosenblatt Securities -- Analyst
Great. Very helpful. If I could follow up, just another question on the R&D path. Your name is Coherent, but I'm not aware of any DSP products or for 400 ZR or any DSP products at the company.
Do you have R&D in DSPs? And what are your thoughts on adding DSPs going forward?
Giovanni Barbarossa -- Chief Strategy Officer and President, Materials Segment
Yeah. We should probably take it off-line because we did announce in the past of our own DSPs, and we have -- of course, we have several Coherent products. We have an entire division around it. And we'll walk you through all of the offerings.
We are very well positioned. We have started with our own -- we have our own DSP design team based in Germany. And we have started with, I would call it, a simple product. And we'll eventually migrate to more complex products over time and be as basically integrated as we can be with our own DSP.
That's our plan. We have to -- we started. We are on a good path. The most significant of the products, of course, the 100G ZR, which adds its own DSP in it, and we announced couple of quarters ago.
And so, that's an example. But we'll walk you through when we are one-on-one with more details if you like.

Good afternoon and welcome to Skyworks Solutions Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2020 Earnings Call. This call is being recorded. At this time, I will turn the call over to Mitch Haws, Investor Relations for Skyworks. Mr. Haws, please go ahead.
Mitch Haws -- Vice President of Investor Relations
Thank you, Cheryl. Good afternoon everyone and welcome to the Skyworks second fiscal quarter 2020 conference call. With me on the call today are Liam Griffin, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Kris Sennesael, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that our discussion will include statements relating to future results and expectations that are or maybe considered forward-looking statements. Please refer to our earnings press release and recent SEC filings including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for information on certain risks that could cause actual outcomes to differ materially and adversely from any forward-looking statements made today.
Additionally, the results and guidance we will discuss include non-GAAP financial measures consistent with past practice. Please refer to our press release within the Investor Relations section of our company website for a complete reconciliation to GAAP. With that, I'll turn the call to Liam.
Liam K. Griffin -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Mitch and welcome everyone. Before we begin the overview of the business and our Q2 results, I wanted to provide an update on the COVID-19 outbreak impacting individuals, companies, governments, and markets across the globe. Our thoughts are with the millions who have suffered the effects of this global pandemic.
At Skyworks, we are deeply engaged with our own employees, a team of more than 9,000 deployed across the globe. Since the crisis began, we have taken early and aggressive actions to protect our people. We've implemented multiple safety protocols including social distancing, daily temperature testing, and heightened sanitation standards. In addition, we initiated rotating shifts at our global manufacturing sites. The implementation of these protective measures has collectively allowed Skyworks to better safeguard employee health while simultaneously supporting our business and manufacturing sites worldwide.
Finally, an update on the temporary suspension of activity in our Mexicali facility. After working in close collaboration with state and local officials in Mexico, we were given permission to resume operations last week. Assuming no further interruptions, we do not expect the temporary suspension to have a significant impact on our business going forward.
Now looking at the second quarter in more detail. We reported revenue of $766 million, in line with our revised guidance. We produced gross margin of 50.2% and operating margin of 32.5%. We posted earnings per share of $1.34 and we generated strong operating cash flow totaling $280 million in the quarter.
Further, our design win momentum reflects our execution across a rapidly evolving business environment, one in which our wireless technologies are playing an essential and critical role. We are enabling markets from telemedicine to emergency response, remote work, online education, real-time security, streaming entertainment, and store-to-door food delivery. Our mission of connecting everyone and everything all the time has never been more relevant.
During this time of social distancing and decreased travel, the technology Skyworks provides have become a primary means of connecting people all over the world. The roll out and adoption of 5G and other advanced wireless technologies such as Wi-Fi 6 and enhanced GPS have become the pillars in support of the vast connected economy. Skyworks is proud to play an integral role in making these vital technologies and essential connections a reality.
During the March quarter, we expanded our engagement with leading customers securing key design wins across numerous applications from the mobile phone to wireless infrastructure, IoT, automotive, machine-to-machine, and medical applications. In mobile, we are leveraging our Sky5 platform across multiple flagship 5G launches including Samsung, Oppo, Vivo, Xiaomi and other Tier 1 players and expanding our technology reach across our customized Diversity Receive platforms with new 5G-centric solutions driving sharp gains in design win count. In IoT, we are supporting high-performance 5G and Wi-Fi enabled tablets specifically developed for health, safety, and telemedicine applications.
Across mobile operators, we are powering 5G hotspots with Verizon and AT&T supporting the expanding work-from-home trend. We're extending our market leadership in Wi-Fi 6 with home and enterprise gateways at Cisco. We're enabling home security applications at Honeywell and ramping remote patient monitoring systems with GE. We're also launching asset tracking and fleet management solutions with Juniper and BlackBerry.
Moving to the infrastructure space, we're supporting 5G Massive MIMO and small cell base station deployments across the U.S., Europe, and Japan and in automotive, we're accelerating connectivity content with leading brands including Volkswagen, Renault, Hyundai, and Nissan. These highlights demonstrate our technology leadership underpinned by a diverse and growing set of critical product categories resolving increasingly complex architectures and preparing our customers for the performance gains demanded in 5G.
In these unprecedented times, our existing technologies and connectivity protocols are processing extraordinarily high data traffic. This explosion in data consumption is taxing networks with real-time video, high-speed processing, streaming content, and a long list of critical services, all dependent upon seamless, reliable, and ubiquitous connectivity.
To illustrate how the pressure on the network capacity is intensifying, just over the last few months, we've seen visits to Amazon website rise more than 30% year-over-year, Zoom Video conferencing passing a milestone of 300 million daily participants, Microsoft Teams platform logging a single day record of 2.7 billion minutes and now with 5G just beginning to launch, the average user today is still working with legacy technologies showing system weakness in this high data demand environment.
Clearly more than ever, always on connectivity is paramount. Skyworks and our partners in the mobile and wireless ecosystems are anticipating and accelerating the development and delivery of much needed cutting-edge technologies led by 5G, Wi-Fi 6, enhanced GPS, and other networking protocols. As Skyworks and the world navigate this challenging environment, our focus will continue to ensure streamlined high-speed connectivity delivering a path for reliable, constant, and safe communication reaching all of our customers and their varied applications. With that, I will turn the call over to Kris for a discussion of Q2 and our outlook for Q3.
Kris Sennesael -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Liam. Skyworks revenue for the second fiscal quarter of 2020 was $766 million, in line with the March 4 updated outlook where we reduced our revenue guidance for the COVID-19 impact by approximately $45 million. At $766 million, revenue is down 5% year-over-year. However, excluding Huawei-related revenue in both Q2 of fiscal '19 and fiscal '20, revenue is up 4% year-over-year despite the negative impact from COVID-19. Gross profit in the second quarter was $384 million resulting in a gross margin of 50.2%. Operating expenses were $135 [Phonetic] million, flat year-over-year as we continue to prudently manage opex while making the necessary investments to accelerate future growth of the business. We generated $249 million of operating income translating into an operating margin of 32.5%. Other income was $4.5 [Phonetic] million and our effective tax rate was 9.4% driving net income of $230 million or $1.34 of diluted earnings per share.
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Second fiscal quarter cash flow from operations was $280 million and capital expenditures was $60 [Phonetic] million resulting in $220 million of free cash flow on $766 million of revenue translating into a strong free cash flow margin of 29%. We paid $75 million in dividends and repurchased 3.2 million shares of our common stock for a total of $284 million. During the last 12 months, we have returned 92% of the free cash flow back to the shareholders through a combination of dividends and share buybacks. We ended the second fiscal quarter with cash and investments of $1.1 billion and we have no debt.
Now let's move on to our outlook for Q3 of fiscal 2020. Given the supply chain and demand disruptions associated with COVID-19, visibility is limited for the June quarter resulting in a wider revenue range compared to prior quarters. For the third fiscal quarter of 2020, we anticipate revenue to be between $670 million and $710 million. We expect gross margin to be approximately 50% and operating expenses flat with Q2 at approximately $135.5 million. Below the line, we anticipate roughly $2.5 million in other income and a tax rate of 9.5%. We expect our diluted share count to further reduce to approximately 170 million shares. Accordingly, at the midpoint of the revenue range, we intend to deliver diluted earnings per share of $1.13. Lastly, I would like to highlight that the company declared a cash dividend of $0.44 per share for Q3 and we intend to continue with our share repurchase program. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Liam.
Liam K. Griffin -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Despite the macro headwinds, Skyworks remains uniquely positioned as a market leader in the most important sectors in technology, capitalizing on our strengths in 5G and other advanced wireless protocols. We have made the critical investments in human capital, intellectual property, and manufacturing scale to usher in a new era of ubiquitous connectivity. Our relentless focus on solving our customers' most challenging problems positions our partners to win by resolving complexity and advancing user experience.
Skyworks' customer-first philosophy drives our product road maps where we leverage unique, customized, system-based solutions, purpose-built to offer interoperability, unprecedented levels of performance. Powered by the strength of our balance sheet and our cash generation capabilities, we are funding the investments that drive sustainable growth, differentiating Skyworks as both a leading technology innovator and a strong provider of consistent cash returns to our shareholders. That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, let's open the lines for questions.

Operator, we're ready for the first question. Cheryl?
Operator
Vivek, your line is open.
Vivek Arya -- BofA Securities -- Analyst
Oh, sorry, I didn't realize. Thanks, thank you for taking my question. I actually had two, one on the June quarter and then second on the calendar second half expectations. So Liam, on the June quarter, I was hoping you could give us some more color. I know it's a little early. Visibility is limited, but how have bookings played out so far. If you could give us some color by geography and mobile versus broad markets and there's some glimmers that China might be recovering. Have you seen that in your business. Just some more color around what you have seen so far in your June quarter?
Liam K. Griffin -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Sure, Vivek, absolutely. What we have seen coming through the March period and then moving into April, we are starting to see some improvement in the demand profile. So, obviously, we weathered some very bumpy seas here in the early part of the year, the whole industry, but our ability to continue to drive design wins and some of the design wins that we consummated earlier at the end of 2019 started to pick up a bit. So we were seeing a pretty rough period here coming through the end of March, but things have improved, I would say quite a bit as we've gotten into the first month of our June quarter and we do expect, again, there is some visibility issues out there, but we feel very confident about the range we put out on the June quarter and we feel very good about the bottom end of that range and we certainly feel like there is a potential for us to go much higher.
Vivek Arya -- BofA Securities -- Analyst
Got it. And then, Liam. On the second half, how are you thinking about the seasonal ramps because what we have heard from some of your peers in the mobile supply chain is that overall phone volumes are lower, but the 5G unit expectations are kind of hanging in there around the 170 million to 200 million unit number for this calendar year. Is that consistent with what you are hearing. Just in general, how should we think about your seasonal ramp going into September, right, which tends to be your strongest sequential growth quarter. Thank you.
Liam K. Griffin -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, great question. So, couple of things. We have high conviction and are really happy with the design win position we have going into the second half of the year. It is really about timing, Vivek, it really is. We think the appetite from the consumer is very, very high. There were supply chain issues earlier in the year for everybody and I think once those supply chain issues resolve and they are resolving, the consumer then has an opportunity to capture that demand with high-end products. So we have very good position with the leading players both in the U.S. and abroad and we do believe that the second half calendar year and Q4 for us are going to be much stronger than what you see in Q3.
Vivek Arya -- BofA Securities -- Analyst
Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava of BMO. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Ambrish Srivastava -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst
Hi, thank you very much. Kris and Liam, I just wanted to get a better sense for your operating plan. How are you modifying it in light of what we're seeing in COVID and specifically how should we be thinking about opex beyond the quarter, capex, as well as capital allocation, are you going to continue with your share buyback? So just wanted more color on those and I had a follow-up.
Kris Sennesael -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yes, Ambrish, we are not changing our operating plan and, of course, we're going to continue to drive the top line growth and as Liam just pointed out, we see a lot of strength especially in -- or we expect a lot of strength, especially in the second half of the calendar year. We are holding our margins above 50% and as the business starts growing, we will see back improvements from a gross margin point of view. From an opex point of view, as you know, we are running a very lean ship, we will continue to do so, we will continue to manage that. There is some discretionary spending reductions that we are putting in place, but at the same time, we will continue to make the necessary investments in R&D and sales and marketing to support our customers and to support the growth in the second half there as well.
From a capital allocation, very similar. We will continue with our capex plan. We will continue to manage that. So where we can see and possibly make some reductions, we will not hesitate to do that, but keep in mind that most of the capex is driven by technology, new technology and filter, BAW filter, very complex assembly and test new technologies and we will make those investments to support 5G ramps and so on. And then last but not least, as we indicated, we will return most of our cash -- free cash flow back to the shareholder, combination of our dividend program as well as continue to execute on our share buyback program.
Ambrish Srivastava -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst
Okay. Sounds good. Sounds like you're very confident about at least things that you can control in light of what we are seeing. I had a very quick follow-up on the inventory days. Days went up a lot. We were expecting March in absolute dollars to go up. Is there a risk of obsolescence here on the inventories side?
Kris Sennesael -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
No, so from an inventory point of view, we are running slightly higher than normal. We actually increased inventory in the March quarter by $44 million and days of inventory is now at 155 days, which is slightly higher than normal, but it is by design, right? We have increased our buffer stocks, we have increased even finished goods inventory. We kept the loading in our factories. Again, it's all in support of the ramp in the second half and we want to make sure we continue to deliver on time to our customer. It actually came in pretty handy. As you know, we had a temporary suspension in our Mexicali factory. We were able to continue to deliver products to our customers. Luckily, that situation now has been resolved. While we are building this inventory, there is very few or little risk from an E&O point of view and despite all of that, we continue to deliver a very strong free cash flow.
Operator
Your next question comes from Chris Caso of Raymond James. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Chris Caso -- Raymond James -- Analyst
Yes, thank you. For first question, can you break down the revenue from the various segments and specifically with the broad market business, if you could talk about the near-term trends that you're seeing in that business as you go into June.
Kris Sennesael -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yes, Chris. So in the March quarter, mobile was approximately 70% of total revenue, which was down mid-teens on a sequential basis which is somewhat in line with normal seasonality and it was flat on a year-over-year basis. Of course, that includes the reduction in Huawei because if I exclude Huawei in Q2 of fiscal '19 and Q2 of fiscal '20, the mobile revenue was actually up 9%, almost 10% on a year-over-year basis driven by content gains as well as the early 5G ramp with our Chinese customers. So our broad markets business was approximately 30% of total revenue in the March quarter. It was down mid-single digits sequentially, but we do expect it to be up sequentially in the June quarter, in part driven by the work-from-home, learn-from-home trends that results in strength in PC, tablets, wearables, Wi-Fi hotspots, the adoption of Wi-Fi 6, and other wireless protocols.
Chris Caso -- Raymond James -- Analyst
Okay, great. Thank you. As a follow-up, perhaps you can give us a little more color on the China business and in particular, I think it's helpful to separate perhaps some of the production issues some of your customers may have had in the March quarter when some of their facilities shut and obviously, it would have gotten better from there, but perhaps to the extent you have visibility in what's happening within demand and how those customers are selling through phones as they get to at least some degree of what's going to be the new normal particularly within China?
Liam K. Griffin -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Sure, Chris. Yeah, what we're seeing is the Chinese accounts actually are recovering faster than some of the other players in the U.S. I think they were the first to be hit by the virus and they are the first to come out of it. So we are benefiting from some of the key brands Oppo, Vivo, Xiaomi, even some new growth now coming up with 5G with Samsung and that portfolio right now is actually -- it's not quite where it was a year ago, but it's starting to move. The 5G penetration is strong and the velocity is picking up.
So I think the unit growth is starting to pick up, but the content within the units is really important to us. So we're seeing very meaningful content improvement in 5G in China and again, we've talked about it before, but you have to have that backward compatibility for 3G, 4G, then 5G. So this is a really nice incremental move for us. There is also a great deal of complexity for the customer and our job is to resolve that and lever the integrated solutions like Sky5 to make it really easy for the client. So we are starting to see that and the Chinese brands today are really starting to move. There is still a lot of upside there from our base today, but they are starting to show some real good progress.
Chris Caso -- Raymond James -- Analyst
Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from Craig Hettenbach of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Craig Hettenbach -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst
Great, thank you. Just following up on the broad markets business. Any additional context you have in terms of supply versus demand. Certainly, there has been some demand impact here, but also customers kind of looking to secure supply. So just curious to how you're seeing that play out in your broad markets business?
Liam K. Griffin -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Sure, Craig, and you're right, I mean there was definitely a period of time and it's still being resolved with some imbalances in supply and demand. There has been quite a bit of demand in broad markets for technologies like Wi-Fi, Wi-Fi 6, even some of the GPS technologies and we deliver those. So we fortunately do the lion's share of our business in-house, right, under our watch and our own factory. So we've been able to be more active, more agile in executing to those demands and a lot of those demands, as Kris mentioned, were driven by new applications work-from-home, again all of the services that are starting to create the opportunity, right, we are seeing today whether it's stay-for-home and entertainment, whatever it maybe, the technologies that we make, not just 5G, but the Wi-Fi and GPS are really moving fast.
So we're getting to a point where the supply and demand intersection is closing, but we do see a meaningful change in user appetite for the technologies, right. I think you're going to see more and more folks now truly adopt telemedicine or truly adopt video conferencing, some of these things that were kind of nascent and really hadn't been played out. So we're looking forward to that and the Wi-Fi 6 technologies as I said, are probably the leader in broad market, but we're also generating new wins with very, very important customers globally that three or four years ago really weren't on our list, names like GE, names like Honeywell, Raytheon to continue really broaden that reach and that side of the market.
Craig Hettenbach -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst
Got it. And then just Liam just for a follow-up, for the flagship phones in the back half of this year, can you talk about just kind of year-to-year, how you're feeling about kind of the content?
Liam K. Griffin -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Sure, sure. Well, as I said, we've got some pretty important players launching 5G and the 5G story is all about incremental content, also incremental complexity and I think it will be revealed that our solutions fare very, very well and our content opportunity was meaningful and we executed on that. So some of that stuff hasn't hit the market yet, but we know we're winning and where we're headed and it's a positive move. We'll start to see that into Q4 and into our fiscal Q1, which would be the December quarter. So Q4 September through December, you're going to see a lot of that traction launch.

Your next question comes from Blayne Curtis of Barclays. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Blayne Curtis -- Barclays -- Analyst
Hey, thanks for taking my question. Liam, just curious, you went through your own factory shut down, but the handset OEMs went through that issue in Q1. You had an up [Phonetic] quarter, it's hard to disseminate because you're obviously I think coming off a very low level and maybe gaining some share, but I'm just kind of curious your perspective on the Android market. Was there any inventory that was built in Q1 and does that rectify itself in Q2 with this guidance?
Liam K. Griffin -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, I think, it feels like we're normalizing right now, Blayne, and starting to get to a point where there is real acceleration in supply chain. As you noted, throughout this period getting from February to now, there has been a tremendous amount of supply chain breakdowns everywhere. We're fortunate that we have our own facilities and we can manage our house pretty well, but it's very challenging for the overall industry with some locations and some factories just not being able to get employees, right, for obvious reasons, for health reasons, but I feel like that's starting to abate now and we're seeing more improvement.
If you look at the Android cycle, we have really good print position with MediaTek, as an example, and they've been a real strong feeder for Asia and other emerging markets. Also we're seeing some really good things as I mentioned with the Oppo, Vivo, Xiaomi names as we go forward and the supply chains today again are getting cleaned up pretty quickly specifically in China and other Asian markets. So we feel like that could pick up and it's another thing, the overall theme here is that we've got a great technology in 5G globally in the industry and the consumer has not had a chance to get there, right. We had supply chain issues, we had some shocks, supply chain shocks in some cases where the technology wasn't there. We have people staying at home that are not going to the stores.
This is all going to abate and the demand and the consumption for the technology is going to be there and I think wireless in this period of time that we've all been dealing with here, stay-at-home period, we recognize that the wireless devices that we have really are the bread and butter of our communication, our ability to work, our ability to communicate with family. It's really important and I think the appetite for the technology is going to only increase and the opportunity for companies like Skyworks, we're happy to play a role in advancing those technologies into the future.
Blayne Curtis -- Barclays -- Analyst
Thanks and I just want to ask you on your BAW efforts and Qualcomm has been very vocal about their confidence in their solid SAW technology, you saw this Broadcom asset I guess ultimately not get sold. Can you point out anything that in terms of what you're shipping today for BAW and then as you look out into the back half of next year in terms of shipping into mid-high band module, where do you see that for Skyworks down the road?
Liam K. Griffin -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Sure. You know the story is getting better and better, Blayne, with respect to BAW. So we have some meaningful design wins that have been shipping, but the quantity of the device count now is going way up. So we're broadening the set of customers and then some of it, very strategic customers, the volumes and units there are picking up. So we actually -- I'm going to give you like a highlight-reel stat here. We crossed 100 million units of BAW-enabled devices about two weeks ago -- since we launched the BAW technology. So we're really pleased at the launch. It's taken a little time, but we're accelerating. We have opportunities across the board with new customers. We have design wins with strategic customers today and we're going to continue to advance that technology and all that stuff is being done in-house with our engineering teams, our fabs, our IP and just driving a technology solution that customers really want.

Your next question comes from Edward Snyder of Charter Equity Research. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Edward Snyder -- Charter Equity Research -- Analyst
Thank you very much. Liam, you mentioned a sharp gain in DRx modules content or design wins based on 5G content. Is any of that due to finally getting a transmit function in the DRx modules to support MIMO, or CA or Diversity or is it still all on the receive side and are you in production on the BAW Duplex again?
Liam K. Griffin -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, I mean, it's a great question. So the DRx category as you know, has really been an incredible performer in mobile device capitalizing on downlink and there is so many variants, Ed, for us. So we have a really wide portfolio in that technology and we are starting to see greater usage across the board. There is so many different versions, whether it's DRx, DSM, ultra high band, mid-band, you can go across the board and we're able to play in each one of those categories and you know, it's a technology that requires very strong, very powerful filtering, the ability to work collectively with potentially LNAs and other technologies and then integrate in a way that works for the customer.
So we're doing really well there and we do want to continue on the BAW side to advance the technology into higher and higher bands and capture more and more of that pie and I think we have some important customers and accounts that work with us that collaboratively we're trying to get to that solution together, but along the way the DRx solutions are gaining a lot of share, a lot of traction. They are extremely valuable to the customer, it's a high-end solution at very fair pricing and allows the customer to get a great end solution. So that technology continues to move -- the bulk acoustic wave technologies again continue to move up, we've demonstrated some volume now, but we still have a lot of room to move from here. I mean by no means have we captured all the business. There's a lot out there for us to go after.
Edward Snyder -- Charter Equity Research -- Analyst
And then on ultra-high band if I could, the sub-six [Phonetic] bands in China requiring both [Indecipherable] for 5G. I mean we're seeing up to five new transmit-receive chains being added to some of the high-end phones. How many of your customers are putting more of a premium on size, so say favoring your dual-band solution versus flexibility on selecting the individual bands that more of the kind of approach that China has taken. I'm trying to get a feel for one, what solution is being favored and two, are you seeing a lot of people opting for kind of the fuller-end high-end solutions that would require more integration. Thanks.
Liam K. Griffin -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, no, it's a great question. So you're right, I mean, [Indecipherable] really important right now in the 5G landscape and you also, you hit another point I didn't make. The integration is so vital. We don't -- the integration for us isn't just kind of a cool thing to package, it is really about densifying the product and Kris mentioned some of our capital investments are really around packaging advancements. We, of course, are developing filters and trying to raise the bar on frequency with our filtering technology, but you also have to have incredible technology on the packaging side to create that miniaturization and with more and more technology squeezed in, you've got 3G, 4G and 5G incremental, you've got transmit, you've got receive, it's very, very complex architecturally.
So those technologies that we have are critical and customers do want it integrated. I mean there is an appetite in some cases for discretes, but that's really moving in the rear view mirror and the new technology, specifically in 5G, are going to be around densification, packaging, and then bringing all of those elements to the customer in an easy, easy form factor.

Your next question comes from Toshiya Hari of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Toshiya Hari -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst
Hi guys, thanks for taking the question. My first one was on your exposure in China. Kris, I think last quarter you guys were kind enough to size your business with the non-Huawei, the OVX camp at around $100 million in the December quarter. I'm curious how big those guys were in the March quarter and what the outlook was into June and related to that, we're getting quite a few headlines related to the U.S.-China trade relationship, any of this kind of potentially impact you guys down the line? Then, I have a quick follow-up.
Kris Sennesael -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, our China business remains on or about 20% of total revenue and we definitely see strength with Oppo, Vivo, Xiaomi as they ramp their 5G phones with strong Skyworks content in it. Unfortunately, the business with Huawei remains at a much lower level than it was historically although we are able to continue to ship under the ban, which is still effective right now.
Toshiya Hari -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst
Got it. And then a quick follow-up on gross margins. I was positively surprised to see gross margins in the quarter essentially come in line with guidance despite lower revenue and I guess similarly into June you're guiding to essentially flat gross margins with a reduced revenue outlook. So I guess I was curious what were some of the offsets in the March quarter. Kris, you spoke to maintaining factory loading. So maybe that's the explanation, but were there any positives that sort of materialized in March and what are some of the potential offsets into June. Thank you.
Kris Sennesael -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, no, I mean we continue to work really hard to improve gross margins and as I talked about that before, one of the most important things is of course is advancing the technology, higher complexity, more value add new products, especially with 5G, Wi-Fi 6 that we bring to market and typically those higher complex type of products demand a higher gross margin and so as we bring those new products to market, you will see a boost from from that. Unfortunately, yes, there is some disruption in the supply chain and some inefficiencies as a result of COVID-19 and so that's why we're not at 53% gross margin today, but we hope that once all those disruption gets out of the supply chain and we start ramping the business, we will see some nice further improvements on the gross margins.

Your next question comes from Craig Ellis of B. Riley FBR. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Craig Ellis -- B. Riley FBR -- Analyst
Yeah, thanks for taking the question and congrats on the financial performance and Liam on the internal BAW milestone, that's a big one for the company given your support there.
Liam K. Griffin -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, thanks very much.
Craig Ellis -- B. Riley FBR -- Analyst
Yeah. You're welcome. What I wanted to do with the first question is just to make sure I'm looking at what you're seeing with integrated mobile correctly over the -- say the 12 to 18-month time period. So we have been shipping Sky5, we continue to do that and it sounds like broadened our OEM base in the quarter and so that sets up well for the back half, you've got 5G Diversity Receive and I wasn't clear if you were saying that was going to ship in volume in the second half or really for next year, but in the second half, our 5G unit should at least double half-on-half for industry just given the projections that are out there from some of the big guys and then next year, hopefully, we don't have a situation where we lose 10% of our sales days due to a virus crisis. So help me, one, understand if the timing for some of the new products is somewhat as I outlined in terms of their impact on financials and what does that mean for next year's growth, are we solidly back in double-digit growth next year for integrated mobile?
Liam K. Griffin -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Great, great questions and lots of ways to think about it. So, I'll tell you what we see now, Craig, and how it plays out into the future. We really are feeling good about the design consummation that we've made here and those products, a lot of those products have not yet shipped and you hit a couple of key points. Sky5, great traction, a lot of room. Diversity Receive, we're delivering that in low-band, mid-band and high-band on the receive side with some great technologies, all of that new. Then, we start to get into the broad markets. We're seeing more and more. I mean, Kris touched on some of it, but we're seeing a real nice run-up in some of the Wi-Fi technologies, Wi-Fi 6 and those are not low-end products. Those are very, very high performing data drivers and then this work-in-home environment and some of the new applications that have been stimulated through this are not going to go away. The appetite is there.
So when you get to the macro view of how do the numbers come together, it's really about timing. The magnitude of the dollars will be up. We know that and we believe that with great conviction. We're coming off of a low point as well. I mean, this is our pivot -- Q3 is our pivot quarter. This is our pivot quarter. We're going to be up and to the right from here and it's just about the rate of change, the rate of revenue and the timing, right. I mean the world really doesn't care about 90-day quarters, it's just about the actual growth and consummation of the demand. So we feel really good about it and there's reason for it, the products are better, the 5G technologies are much faster, they are more reliable, better latency, you can move it into IoT, there's just a lot to do and unfortunately, this COVID-19 thing showed up, no one expected it and it put the brakes on the business and now we're starting to recover, but we still feel really good about the outcome and where we're headed. Our factories are positioned well, we're in extremely close communication with every one of our customers working hand-in-hand to consummate and intersect their supply, our demand, their demand, our supply working it together.
So it's a great opportunity for companies like Skyworks to shine. We have our own facilities, we develop at a chip level and then integrate at a systems level, we can create flexibility for whatever market the customers want to roam in, what their size constraints maybe, what their current consumption maybe and weave that all together for a solution, but we feel really good about the macro theme here. It's been delayed unfortunately, but we see that starting to come back by the end of this quarter and certainly into our Q4 in the second half calendar.
Craig Ellis -- B. Riley FBR -- Analyst
That's helpful. And then the follow-up is just on broad markets and one of the comments from your recent remarks and earlier as you went through some of the applications for which broad markets is seeing good demand and had some run rate [Phonetic] whether it be auto or others, one of the things I don't think I heard previously but was on today's call was telemedicine and so the question is in the world that we're now in beyond telemedicine, are there other application areas that are coming into the broad markets portfolio as new incremental TAM for you and if so, what would they be? Thanks, Liam.
Liam K. Griffin -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, I think the video conferencing dynamic is incredible. I'm sure everybody that's on this call has been using that recently and even the best technology out there today is still not good enough in my opinion and I think the appetite for that is really going to create some interesting dynamics for us. I think that's one really important one.
I think the service community is going to be a big deal right now. I mean people are -- you're seeing how the world has evolved. We talked about some stats about whether it's Microsoft Teams or or Zoom or stay-at-home food delivery, these are things that I don't think they're going to go away even when the COVID-19 pandemic is done, I think there is going to be some lasting behavior and some of that's very good behavior for our business where the consumer is going to rely more and more on wireless technologies and remote technologies to live their life in, whether it's education, whether it's healthcare, whether it's entertainment all of those services are provided and can be provided through wireless technologies that we bring to market.

Your next question is from Bill Peterson of J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Bill Peterson -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst
Yeah, hi, good afternoon and thanks for taking the questions. I guess the first question as it relates to COVID-19 impacts, in this case, on the supply chain, it's good to see obviously Mexicali coming back, but there's obviously a lot of talk that there could be multiple phases of this virus. I'm wondering, I guess how -- what percentage is coming from Mexicali, what are the opportunities or have you considered outsourcing and what are the contingency plans and I guess how conceivable is it if you did need to bring up a secondary or third party to manufacture some of your products.
Kris Sennesael -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yes, so Bill, so approximately 70%, 75% of the revenue is being generated out of the back-end facility in Mexicali. Now, before this whole COVID-19 pandemic started, we were already building a more diverse supply chain and so we have already started to shift part of our supply chain with third-party assembly and test houses out there mostly in Asia and so that's obviously a trend that we will continue to do so.
Bill Peterson -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst
Okay, thanks for that. And I know you guys constantly talk about crafting solutions, working side-by-side with customers. I guess with a lot of the lock downs in place globally, how has that impacted your design activities. I mean I presume, obviously, your second half design wins are well locked and loaded, but as we think about next year, how are you working with your customers to craft these solutions?
Liam K. Griffin -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, I mean we are doing that, but it's not has been far less face-to-face, hand-to-hand kind of communication, right? So we're not shoulder to shoulder like we used to be and we will be again, but in the meantime, we've got really clever engineers with customers that are very smart and we're using the technologies we talked about, we're doing video conferencing, Microsoft Teams, lot of conference calls, lot of sharing of PowerPoint and openness as we go through this.
So it is a different dynamic. I think most of us prefer the in-person contact, but it's one of the things that may change, right. I think the world may change as a result, there could be more and more distance based communication and again that's more of a wireless play, but in the meantime, we're staying extremely close with our customers, we're taking care of our people, we're being good citizens in that regard and we're hoping that we can all get through this together and look forward to better days.

Your last question comes from Harsh Kumar of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Harsh Kumar -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst
Yeah. hey guys, thanks for squeezing me in. So, Liam or Kris, question for you. In the last six months, revenues are down roughly, call it $200 million, but your margins are within a band of basically 20 basis points, 30 basis points. So the question is how, I mean what have you guys done here to basically keep your margins up despite the fact that your utilization I assume is down quite a bit despite the fact that you might have built a little bit of inventory, I'm just curious.
Kris Sennesael -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
No Harsh, I mean this is, as I indicated before, a lot of hard work from the team and there's multiple elements that come into play, right? There is more complex, higher value-add products that we bring to the market. That's very important. We continue to execute well. Secondly, of course, it's driving down the cost in our factories and our third-party suppliers building a very efficient operations and then of course we do have a little bit of a tailwind from a mix point of view as broad markets is growing and has some higher margins compared to the mobile business. As you know, our target model is 53%. If it wasn't for the headwinds that you just indicated, we would have been there already, but unfortunately we have to deal with those headwinds and we dealing with it. And so, as I indicated before, in the second half of 2020 and beyond, when those headwinds become tailwinds, we will see some nice further gross margin improvements.
Harsh Kumar -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst
It's pretty impressive guys, I just wanted to ask if there was anything going on and then secondly, we've heard a lot, you guys have called out China particularly in the new 5G phones, you know, Oppo, Vivo etc in the last few calls and I was curious if you guys are actually you think you're actually gaining a lot of share or is it just a situation where China as a country is going to 5G and you're just getting a fair share there.
Liam K. Griffin -- President and Chief Executive Officer
No, the way we see it and we have really good intel on this is that we are gaining a lot of share and part of it is the ability to do that integration and make it easy for the customer. So there's a great deal of interest and appetite in demand in China for a 5G product and what we're doing is we're bringing in a highly complex configured customer by customer Sky5 platform so that those customers don't have to deal with all the complexity and burden of laying out 40, 50 different discrete devices to create a 5G engine. We're going to do it for them. And so that's been really the play for us and it's worked out great. It gives our customers a faster time to market. It lowers their need for an engineering burden, we can do that for you and then we bring it to the market uniquely and differentiated.

Liam Griffin -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Mitch, and welcome, everyone. Skyworks delivered a strong start to the fiscal year, establishing all-time quarterly records for revenue and free cash flow. Looking at the quarter in more detail. We delivered revenue of $1.51 billion, above consensus and up 15% sequentially, demonstrating the strength of our broadening product portfolio.
Specifically, the mobile business grew 12% sequentially, driven by increasingly complex architectures in 5G phones at our largest customer and momentum across the Android ecosystem. In parallel, our broad markets business achieved a record $477 million in the quarter, up 23% sequentially and 46% year over year. Our growth was fueled by both the continued adoption of our solutions across 5G, IoT, automotive and wireless infrastructure, and an expanding set of new customers and markets from our recently acquired I&A business. Importantly, Skyworks continues to drive strong profit margins and exceptional cash flow.
We achieved gross margin of 51.2% and operating margin of 38.8%. We posted earnings per share of $3.14, above consensus and up 20% sequentially. Finally, we generated record Q1 operating cash flow of $582 million. As our first quarter results illustrate the growth trajectory we established in fiscal 2021 is extending into fiscal 2022.
We continue to see deployments accelerating with 5G cellular subscriptions predicted to grow from 700 million today to more than 4.4 billion by the year 2027. As connectivity becomes more vital to the ways we work, educate, and play, devices are increasingly integrating 5G with advanced WiFi, precision GPS, Bluetooth, Zigbee, and other wireless protocols, creating the seamless and ultrafast experience demanded by our customers. The rapid adoption of new wireless technologies enables a proliferating set of use cases with design wins spanning mobile and broad markets, further bolstered by contributions from our recently completed acquisition. Specifically in mobile, we shipped Sky5 platforms across leading smartphone OEMs, including Samsung, Oppo, Vivo, and Xiaomi, among others.
In Enterprise and IoT, we supported WiFi access points at Siemens, powered NETGEAR's latest WiFi 6 and 6E mesh system, partnered with British Telecom to launch 5G home routers, ramped WiFi 6 and 6E modules at Juniper Networks and Telus, and provided digital isolation solutions for GE consumer appliances. Moving to automotive. We leverage Sky5 technology to enable telematics, security, driver assist, and other advanced services at leading OEMs. We scaled volume production of timing and isolation products enabling the leading EV manufacturers.
And finally, across the infrastructure and industrial space, we captured design wins at Quectel for enterprise M2M platforms, delivered industrial IoT solutions to Itron, Honeywell, and Thales, supporting smart energy and factory automation. We also expanded our position in timing applications at the top five data centers. And as markets evolve, we expect to deploy billions of wireless devices, capitalizing on a strong multiyear growth trend. Advances in cloud and edge computing, autonomous vehicles and factory automation, together with the emergence of the Metaverse, we are intensifying the burden on existing networks, catalyzing demand for our highly integrated and customized platforms.
From inception, Skyworks has been a driving force empowering the wireless network revolution, connecting people, places and things. We invested early and extensively to develop and fabricate cutting-edge technology at massive scale. Today, we're a global leader providing the essential elements required to deliver the highest performance connectivity platforms in the industry, producing billions of units integrating core technology nodes, including gallium arsenide, Belton surface acoustic wave, as well as the most advanced multi-chip module test and assembly capabilities in the world. Underpinned by this powerful foundation, we are leading the transition of 5G inspiring a new era of unrivaled innovation.
The strength of our balance sheet and consistent outperformance demonstrates the significant value of our vertically integrated model and the compelling advantages it delivers. Looking forward, we are committed to supporting the strategic investments in technology, product development, and world-class manufacturing scale to further extend our market leadership. With that, I will turn the call over to Kris.
Kris Sennesael -- Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Liam. Skyworks' revenue for the first fiscal quarter of 2022 was 1.51 billion, up 15% sequentially, driven by continued strong demand across our entire portfolio. Gross profit in the first quarter was 773 million, resulting in a gross margin of 51.2%, up 20 basis points sequentially. Operating expenses were 187 million or 12.4% of revenue, demonstrating leverage in our operating model while continuing our strategic investments in support of future growth.
We generated 586 million of operating income translating into an operating margin of 38.8%, up 160 basis points sequentially. We incurred 9 million of other expenses, and our effective tax rate was 9.3%, driving net income of 543 million. So strong revenue growth and execution on margins brought diluted earnings per share of $3.14, up 20% sequentially. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow.
First fiscal quarter cash flow from operations was a Q1 record of 582 million. Capital expenditures were 96 million, resulting in an all-time record free cash flow of 486 million and a free cash flow margin of 32%, driven by strong profitability and great working capital management. In fact, inventory levels were reduced by 22 days to 103 days, and receivables were reduced by five days to 47 days. In terms of capital allocation during the quarter, we paid 93 million in dividends and repaid 50 million of our term loan, and we repurchased 1.7 million shares of our common stock for a total of 269 million.
In summary, the Skyworks team continues to execute well, delivering strong profitability, and rapid free cash flow in the December quarter with design wins across our growing product portfolio and customer set, positioning us to outperform through 2022. Now let's move on to our outlook for Q2 of fiscal '22. We expect to deliver double-digit year-over-year revenue and earnings-per-share growth in the March quarter. Specifically, we anticipate revenue between 1.3 billion and 1.36 billion.
At the midpoint of 1.33 billion, revenue for the quarter is expected to increase 13.5% year over year. Gross margin is projected to be in the range of 50.75% to 51.25%. We expect operating expenses of approximately 186 to 188 million. Below the line, we anticipate roughly 10 million in other expense and a tax rate of approximately 9.5%.
We expect our diluted share count to be approximately 166 million shares. Accordingly, at the midpoint of the revenue range, we intend to deliver diluted earnings per share of $2.62, an increase of 11% over Q2 of last year. And finally, given our strong cash flow and confidence in the business model, we will continue to focus on investing in our business while returning cash to the shareholders through both share repurchases and dividends. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Liam.
Liam Griffin -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Kris. Despite macro challenges in supply chain specific headwinds, Skyworks delivered excellent first quarter results, underscoring the increasingly diverse composition of our customer base and extending our track record of strong profitability and robust free cash flow generation. This strong performance and outlook reflect our critical position within the wireless ecosystem and how complexity favors Skyworks with its vast IP, deep customer relationships, differentiated manufacturing capabilities, and market-leading solutions. The momentum established in Q1 positions Skyworks for another year of record revenue and earnings.
That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, let's open the lines for questions.
Questions & Answers:
Operator
Thank you. [Operator instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Chris Caso with Raymond James. Sir, your line is open.
Chris Caso -- Raymond James -- Analyst
Yes. Thank you. Good evening. I guess for the first question, can you help us detailing the breakout of broad markets versus mobile in the quarter? And what your expectations are for those markets as we go forward into March?
Kris Sennesael -- Chief Financial Officer
Yes, Chris. So as we indicated in the prepared remarks, we had very strong performance in growth markets. It was roughly 32% of our total revenue, compared to 22% last year. And so we saw a very strong growth, 23% sequentially, 46% on a year-over-year basis, and the growth was driven by ongoing strong demand for wireless connectivity, especially as it relates to IoT solutions.
In addition to that, we have a strong contribution, all-time record from the acquired business of the infrastructure & automotive business as well. So great execution in growth markets. On the flip side, of course, you have Mobile, which was in the December quarter, approximately 68% of revenue. It was up 12% sequentially.
It was down 13% year over year, but you have to take into account the timing of the ramp of flagships, especially last year, where you -- just to remember, the large customer was -- had a condensed ramp with a late launch in the late October, early November time frame. This year, the launch was spread over the September and the December quarter, but great execution there as well in mobile. As it relates to the March quarter, we typically don't really guide by segments, but we just provided the guidance for the March quarter, which is up 13.5% year over year. We do expect both segments to grow double-digit year over year, of course, stronger in broad markets than it is in mobile.
Chris Caso -- Raymond James -- Analyst
OK. And just following on to some of the comments that you made with respect to seasonality. And last year, seasonality was skewed, as you said, because of the late launch of the phones. But this year, there were also capacity constraints affecting your customers also.
So as your largest customer said that they weren't able to ship as much as they wanted in the December quarter. How does that affect seasonality for the March quarter this year? And does it have any implications for June as well if some of your customers perhaps are catching up with unfulfilled demand during the March quarter?
Kris Sennesael -- Chief Financial Officer
Yes, Chris. So again, if you look at the guide we provided for March, down 12% sequentially, up 13.5% year over year. But the down 12% sequentially is actually slightly better than normal seasonality if you compare to the last five years for the March quarter. As you probably remember from the call of our large customer, they left some revenue on the table in the December quarter, and they're still trying to catch up, and they see improvements going into the March quarter.
Looking ahead for June, again, we only guide one quarter at a time, but sitting here today, I don't see any reason why June would not be in line with normal seasonality. So we do expect normal seasonality for the June quarter. Also, keep in mind that June is just a transition quarter, right? We feel very strong, based on our technology road map, the products, the design win momentum and the design wins that we have on the book right now, we feel very strong for further sequential growth into the September and December quarter typically, as you see, with strong performance in the second half of the year.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Gary Mobley with Wells Fargo Securities. Sir, your line is open.
Gary Mobley -- Well Fargo Securities -- Analyst
Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I'm going to pick up right relet off, Kris and ask specifically what you would classify or quantify as a typical June quarter over quarter seasonal comp focusing specifically on the mobile business? And then I have a follow-up.
Kris Sennesael -- Chief Financial Officer
Yes. So for the total company, if you look at the average of the last five years, in June, we have been flat to down 5%. So call it, an average 3, 4% down sequentially in the June quarter. That's the average of the last five years.
Gary Mobley -- Well Fargo Securities -- Analyst
And that's mobile specifically, to be clear?
Kris Sennesael -- Chief Financial Officer
That is mostly driven by mobile.
Gary Mobley -- Well Fargo Securities -- Analyst
OK. All right. And then switching gears over to the broad markets business. I know that you have been capacity constrained for that business, but I presume given the upside that you delivered in the December quarter, that's less of an issue or turned out to be less of an issue.
So maybe if you can give us an update on where you stand with expanding capacity to support the broad markets business, how the backlog is trending for that business in relationship to the improved supply? And that's it for me.
Liam Griffin -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yes. Sure. This is Liam. Well, as noted in the prepared remarks, we had a record broad market quarter, $477 million, 46% year over year.
There's just a lot more for us to do in those areas. We are extending the reach of customers -- new customers. We're driving more complex cellular engines, IoT engines to our customer base, also gaining some traction, meaningful traction with the I&A portfolio from Silicon Labs. So that's coming together.
And there's so much opportunity in the broad markets business, and we're happy to see the numbers that we're discussing now. But the market TAM there is substantial, if you think about the scale and scope of where we can take our products. So there's a lot of work to be done there, but we're really pleased with the effort. Our team is doing well, having some new customers in our corner is always great, and we're going to continue to drive in that way.
So good stuff and a lot of good technical synergy as well. So most of these products do have a kind of a common core in some cases. So it does help us drive through our supply chain very effectively in high velocity and leveraging that scale that we talk so much about.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava from BMO. Your line is open.
Ambrish Srivastava -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst
Thank you very much. Apparently tight execution on the balance sheet and cash on the cash flow side. Kris, just a quick -- this is a housekeeping. What should we expect capex to be for this year? And then I had a quick follow-up, please.
Kris Sennesael -- Chief Financial Officer
Yes. So capex in the quarter was 96 million, which is somewhat light, but we don't really manage the capex quarter by quarter. We will definitely continue to invest. This is still early stages in a multiyear 5G upgrade cycle.
As Liam just explained, there's a lot of growth opportunities and growth markets. And so we will continue to further invest in our manufacturing, adding more size and scale, but at the same time, also supporting the technology road maps. We have major success with bulk acoustic wave, and so we are -- the revenue of integrated devices that have BAW filters inside is growing very strong, and we're supporting that. We're also making the necessary investments in Mexicali in our back-end operation, supporting advanced packaging and test.
And so again, we have a lot of growth opportunity for us. We will support that, and we will continue to expand the capacity and pay capex.
Ambrish Srivastava -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst
Sorry, Kris. So just in terms of numbers, double digit, low double digit is the right number to be modeling?
Kris Sennesael -- Chief Financial Officer
Double-digit.
Ambrish Srivastava -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst
OK. OK. And then for my follow-up is, Liam, for you on the broad markets business. What's now that you have included the Silicon Lab business, what's the right way to think about the longer-term CAGR for this business? Thank you.
Liam Griffin -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yes, absolutely. We definitely see great opportunity in that portfolio as it is right now. And so levering around that is a very substantial sales team from the core Skyworks still leveraging the I&A portfolio. We've done really well in the last couple of months of introducing the I&A products and technologies to customers that we already have, proven customers that we do a lot of business with, which is a great synergy for us.
We are scaling operationally. The majority of the portfolio and the I&A business had been more of a fabless play. Over time, we're going to bring that technology under our own roof here at Skyworks and leverage the great scale that we have. So it's a lot of really interesting things that we're doing on the inside inward looking, but there's tremendous opportunity on the outbound side.
So lot of activity, great people. The spirit in the business there is very high and the opportunity that we have is tremendous. We really have a small piece of the total opportunity size that product line can bring. So I think we're excited about the opportunity.
We'll continue to report on our results. But thus far, things have been going really well.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Sir, your line is open.
Blayne Curtis -- Barclays -- Analyst
Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to follow back on the mobile side and just make sure I heard you saying, just because we've heard it from so many other companies. But in terms of the March seasonality, I mean, we've heard that the largest customer has been pulling more product and maybe has less than a typical seasonal period. They're also launching a new phone to add 5G.
So that's all good. So I'm just trying to understand, are you seeing that -- because you made comments that June should be normal, and I think you've now had a couple of companies talk about June being down more, because March is stronger. I just want to just go back to that point and make sure I understand what you're saying.
Liam Griffin -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Sure, Blayne. This is Liam. Yes, I think what you may see here is relatively typical demand cycle. But then within that demand cycle, where is the technology and how do you grow that technology even in constant units, right? So I mean it won't be constant units, but if we have a baseline.
Some of the enthusiasm around our view going into June is really about design wins that we have squarely in our sight. In some cases, design wins that have been consummated, they haven't shipped yet. So a lot of that is Skyworks specific. But the typical calendar or fiscal cycles that we tend to see are still relatively in place.
But I will tell you that the opportunity within the devices that we're serving and with the customers that we're serving, we're seeing growth potential there. And that's much more predictable for us. Because we know exactly what we're winning, we know exactly where that's going. We know how to prepare that operationally and still do that shoulder-to-shoulder with the leading customers.
So we feel really good about it. The macro seasonality could be a little bit different, but we feel very confident in what we're going to do.
Blayne Curtis -- Barclays -- Analyst
And then just a question for Kris. I think when you bought the Silicon Labs business, you're going to require -- retire debt quite quickly. I think you were actually pretty active on the buyback for December. So with the pullback in the stock, are you thinking about that differently? And anything you can talk about for the remainder of this fiscal year in terms of buybacks versus debt retirement?
Kris Sennesael -- Chief Financial Officer
Yes, Blayne. So currently, we have still $2.2 billion of debt on the balance sheet in addition to $1 billion of cash. So we feel really good about our liquidity position today. In terms of even gross debt, it's less than a turn of EBITDA.
And so given where the stock is trading today and what it was trading over the last three months, we have switched on the buybacks again, and we will continue to do so going forward.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Edward Snyder with Charter Equity Research. Sir, your line is open.
Edward Snyder -- Charter Equity -- Analyst
Thanks a lot. A couple if I could. So, Liam, Skyworks traditionally has been very strong in Wi-Fi, the 2.4 gig section, I think you own when they use external amps. But that's always been shipped in the phone business into a SIP, a system in a package from somebody else, combined with a lot of other products.
But it looks like now finally, the Android ecosystem is moving to more of an RF module architecture and where they'll break out the RF separately. So I kind of understand what that means from a content point of view, especially with WiFi 6E. But I suppose as a problem does it. I mean because now in addition to the amps, you've got to have the best filters, 2.4 uses a tough BAW filter and WiFi 6E will use a tough BAW filter.
So one, are you seeing this shift to modules and WiFi finally? And two, does it present any difference in content opportunity for you? Does it go up? Does it go down? Does it stay the same? How do you characterize Skyworks' positioning if the Android world moves in mass to this new architecture? And I have a follow-up.
Liam Griffin -- President and Chief Executive Officer
No, that's a good question. I think -- I don't know if everybody followed that, but I know where you are. So the bottom line on that, which is correct, we have an outstanding position in WiFi today. Just let me make that clear, very substantial.
And it's been going great. But there has been improvements in technology and demand for higher speeds and higher performance. And in those cases, bulk acoustic wave is a critical element within the WiFi system. So we have ramped WiFi -- we have ramped our bulk acoustic wave technology, obviously, in smart with a lot of work, a lot of investment, and that's been going great.
And now we're seeing that move into WiFi. And we have design wins now that capture bulk acoustic wave within a WiFi system, multiple customers. So it's another vector of growth for Skyworks. We -- and that -- a lot of that is in the broad market side.
It's very diverse. It's certainly -- we love our handset business, but you've got a handful of customers. When you get into the connectivity nodes around WiFi and other cases, you have a broadening there. So we're in good position there and a great position also now to start to lever up bulk acoustic wave beyond the mobile phone.
Edward Snyder -- Charter Equity -- Analyst
So it's safe to say you're shipping a coexisting BAW filter at 2.4 gig, which is one of the reasons I thought you even started the BAW to protect your business --
Liam Griffin -- President and Chief Executive Officer
We do we have that. We do have those today, and we're going to continue to go higher in frequency as we move along.
Edward Snyder -- Charter Equity -- Analyst
OK. Then if I could. You did very well on flagship phones last round. They're now finally moving the transmitter into the diversity section and you landed that, which is a big coup.
So two questions if I could. What does the content opportunity look like at your large discussers in that area? Because it tends -- you tend to really dominate the diversity section and of course, the low bands, too. But now that they've already added that, are we going to see any bigger kickers or have we got most of what we need there. And then how does this play out with everybody else, Samsung in the Chinese OEMs, one, when do you think they'll move to the transmit in DRx? Two, do you think the same dynamic competitively will play out where you're going to kind of sweep that out and push wherever else like Murata out of it like you did on the flagships?
Liam Griffin -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yes, yes. So on the higher end, the opportunity there, we talked about driving higher performance and filtering and moving up the data rate going to 6E, all that's working. But then if you go down to the mid-tier, there's just -- there's tremendous opportunity, because there's still -- the vast majority of phones in the Android world in some of the markets in China are just now stepping up with the higher-performing filters. And they get great performance return for that.
So we're doing a lot of work and shoulder-to-shoulder design and work with customers to make sure they see the merits of this technology. And the performance upside that they gain for a couple of incremental dollars. So I think there's a great opportunity there, coming from a low base, too. So that's not -- isn't just a simple upgrade cycle.
It's coming from a very low base to mid- to higher end, and we'll continue to work along that curve. And the know-how that you build in mobile and in RF translates very well. So all the hard work and the engineering talent that we have at Skyworks that's been working on flagship phones for years and years. They know how to scale when it goes into WiFi and some of these other wireless technology.
So we look forward to leveraging that skill set as we meet with new customers.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Craig Ellis with B. Riley Securities. Sir, your line is open.
Craig Ellis -- B. Riley Financial -- Analyst
Yes. Thanks for taking the questions. Congratulations on the nice quarter and cash flow. I wanted to start with an operational question.
So clearly, we've got a very strong demand environment out there right now. And Kris, it sounds like you expect the business to be seasonally strong in the back half of the year. So can you just talk a little bit about how you plan to manage manufacturing loadings as we go through the calendar first and second quarter or your fiscal second, third quarters? Should we expect to see that you'll build inventory to put yourself in a position or for whatever reason would inventory stay at a relatively lower level here?
Kris Sennesael -- Chief Financial Officer
Yes, Craig. I mean we do that every year, because we do have some large seasonal swings in our business, right? We have typically strong sequential growth in September, December, and then down in March and kind of flattish to slightly down in June. That's the seasonal pattern. We're, of course, trying to maximize factory utilization and drive efficient use of our capital equipment.
And so we are always level loading as much as we can. It's not perfect. That's why you also see some seasonal fluctuations in the gross margins there as well. But we definitely will try to maximize that.
Also, you know in this business, the design wins, we know them way ahead, right? So we know what we win, we know the product. We can start building to a certain extent ahead of it, and we do that every year.
Craig Ellis -- B. Riley Financial -- Analyst
Yes. Got it. That's helpful. And then I'll flip one over to Liam.
Liam, I think there's a general view out there that this year will be a year for somewhere around 40% growth in the smartphone market, really as we ship a lot more midrange 5G smartphones. So I know you just talked about some of the things you're excited about on the Android ecosystem. But is it possible to put a quantification around the degree of content gain that's left at that tier of the market and beyond that tier what's still possible for Skyworks?
Liam Griffin -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Sure. Sure. Yes. I mean we have two vectors, right? We have kind of the mid-tier moving up and then you have the premium devices really stepping up with high performance.
And both of those portfolios have been great for us. And I think our ability, the years and years of time and investment, and shoulder-to-shoulder engineer work, we basically follow the lead with our customers. So we're very flexible. We can go to the highest end and we can also bring companies that haven't engaged and get them on board.
And so that continues to grow. And the merits of mobility and wireless connectivity, everyone on the call knows how important that is. So there's a lot of opportunity there. And then if you move out of smartphones, Craig, we had a question on that a few minutes ago.
We just -- we're really excited by the potential for proliferating connectivity everywhere, right? You're hearing more about M2M, you're hearing more about automotive. These are real markets right now. There's WiFi opportunity. It could be cellular.
All of these end markets have great promise for us beyond just the mobile phone and the technologies that we have and the in-house scale that we have really creates flexibility. So we don't have a one-stop shop. We can be very crafty and configured -- configurable with our customer, depending on the application. So there's a lot of really interesting design wins that we have that really come about with customer problems and our engineers huddling together to solve it.
So it's really cool to see. And you're going to see more and more growth around that. But still, the connectivity vector is the primary element here to make it all work.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Brett Simpson with Arete Research. Sir, your line is open.
Brett Simpson -- Arete Research -- Analyst
Yes. Thanks very much. Maybe two big picture questions, and maybe for Liam. First, just Android as a market opportunity for Skyworks.
I guess your mobile business is much more skewed toward iOS historically. But if I look at Android, we probably look at about $1 billion of revenue for Skyworks every year, and there's more than 1 billion units shipping for Androids. So you're getting sort of less than $1 today of RF content on average. And I guess just moving to 5G and more modules.
Can you perhaps just talk about the opportunity that you see ahead of yourselves in terms of getting more strategic with customers or where you think you can really start to sort of grow your average content per unit in the Android ecosystem? Thanks.
Liam Griffin -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Sure. Sure. That's a great question. Yes, and you're right.
I think there's a lot more opportunity in Android now for us to go get. And it's really about an education opportunity for us. And we're working with these customers. We're demonstrating what a little bit of incremental content can do in terms of the end user's experience.
So there's a lot more of a drive there. We absolutely -- it's not a technical hurdle for us. I mean we know how to do it. It's more around how do we craft the solution that provides the technology and the performance and does it at a price point and a cost point for us, where it makes a lot of sense.
And that's happening now, because as you start to see 5G really accelerate, to really get the performance that's been promised and that's been desired, you've got to put in more content -- you got to put in more filtering as we talked about already in the call. You need to raise the performance of your gallium arsenide technologies, you got to bring them in. You got to look at your packaging and test, and the coexistence issues that happen when you have more and more of these technologies in a single application, whether the application is a phone or something else. So there's a lot there.
A couple of things I would say. In the last several months, we've been doing much, much better at the higher end of Android. Customers like Samsung have been very strong. And these are on the new platforms.
These are on the highest performing new platforms that they're offering. And then we're going to bring along the Oppo, Vivo, Xiaomi, players. In aggregate today, those are still very significant for us, but the content opportunity from today's baseline and where it could go over the next two to three years is quite substantial. So the point that you made at the beginning is definitely well taken.
So that's how we see that, and we've got great inroads right now on products that will -- they have a little bit of a different cycle than some of the large U.S. players, but you should see a lot more content from Skyworks in Android products going into the second half of the year and into 2023.
Brett Simpson -- Arete Research -- Analyst
Great. Maybe just a follow-up, Liam, on Ed's question on WiFi. I guess, there's something like over 4 billion units of Wi-Fi that ship every year. And I'd just love to understand the RF TAM or the opportunity set that you see, especially with the transition to 6E and some of the changes that we're going to see and how this is packaged up.
But I guess we could expect PCs and routers and smartphones and TVs to move quite aggressively toward 6E over the next sort of year or two. But is there anything you can share with us in terms of your strategy and how you plan to address this? Because I guess this transition should be quite positive for RF players like Skyworks that's done very well traditionally in the WiFi space.
Liam Griffin -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yes. No, that's a great point. So the appetite for high-en2d WiFi has really accelerated, and you can see the use case opportunity everywhere now, right? You do consumer products all the way to the super high end, you have WiFi, whether it's 6 or 6E. So that's all going to move in the right direction for us.
And so one of the things that will happen as we move along the curve in Wi-Fi, it will actually create a cycle, not unlike what you see in mobile, where content grows and then content continues to move as the application and the burden on the technology rises, right. That the more important, the higher the speed, the more efficient it needs to be, that's going to require better technology on the semiconductor and the filtering side. So that plays together very, very well for Skyworks. And think about us as kind of the mid- to high-tier player, but we can step into that low end of the market, too.
But we are seeing a lift when you start to look at 6 and 6E in Wi-Fi. There's bulk acoustic wave filters there that we've already talked about on this call, but very, very important in the higher-end WiFi. And not today, highly populated. It's a cycle there that is on the upswing and it's still early.
And we have the know-how to do it. So the wonderful thing there is we have the key elements to get it done. Similar elements that we would have in a high-end smartphone, but position and scale that configured in a way to deliver WiFi signals versus cellular. So there's a lot of opportunity there, and it plays into core technologies that we have in-house.
So that's a really good question, and it is a key element in our strategy in broad markets is to do more and raise the bar there on overall WiFi performance.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Tristan Gerra with Baird. Sir, your line is open.
Tristan Gerra -- Baird -- Analyst
Hi. Good afternoon. So you've talked about the strength and opportunities in the Android ecosystem. A few years ago, you really had a greenfield of opportunities in the three to six gigahertz range, notably at your key customer.
So how should we look at the competitive landscape now with Qualcomm recently announced Ultra RS in the sub-70 gig range, MediaTek also getting in that segment. So it feels like that three to six gig segment is where you've gained a significant share a few years ago starting to get more crowded. And I'm wondering whether there could be ramifications of that, including in the Android ecosystem.
Liam Griffin -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yes. I mean we're actually in a pretty significant growth path with the bulk acoustic wave filtering technology that would populate the three to six gig range. We also have a great deal of know-how and complexity on both transmit and receive and also the way to integrate the complexity around that. So when you're dealing with the high-end smartphones that would demand that kind of performance, you got to have the isolation, you've got to have the form fit and factor to integrate all of that.
Because you're going to carry all of the existing 4G ,5G stuff around it, and then you have to populate when you get to three to six gig, there's going to be some additional filtering. And that has to all be coexisting in a way that makes perfect sense within the device itself, current consumption, etc., size, and scale. So we know how to do that. There's absolutely no gap at all, and we are populating three to six gig now.
And as we mentioned, our BAW filter technology is very robust, extremely competitive in populating some of the most iconic highest-performing phones today. So that same recipe can scale across Android, can go to the highest end, Smartphones, can find itself in applications that are not mobile applications like automotive, for example. So we have the keys for that. So that's something to work on.
The market, in some cases, is just starting to demand this technology. In some cases, the market has been behind the technology. But now we're starting to see the intersection with the high-performance technology and the needs of the consumer and the market together. And I think that's where things really are going to accelerate.
Tristan Gerra -- Baird -- Analyst
OK. Great. And then as a quick follow-up, obviously, you have opportunities for content increases and share gains. How do you look at the inventory situation in China smartphone OEMs? And is that something we should get concerned over the next few quarters?
Liam Griffin -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yes. for us, we don't see anything -- I mean, there's some bumpiness there, but not in the portfolios that we're driving right now. We keep a very, very lean view of our products. And Kris mentioned it in terms of our days of inventory, etc., we're very -- we're not a big distribution play.
We're kind of like we go direct. So we have a very clear view of where the demand is, where the products are. And for the most part, things have been kind of short in terms of supply chain, which has limited some of our customers and created some imbalance. I think some of that's getting ironed out now.
With Skyworks, as you know, we -- the lion's share of our business is done in-house. We have our own gallium arsenide technology. We have our own TC-SAW, standard SAW, bulk acoustic wave, assembly and test, all that stuff is in-house. So we're able to execute extremely well even if the conditions are choppy out there in the supply chain.
So there can be some movement around that. But we feel very good about our ability to execute in that way.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Kevin Cassidy with Rosenblatt Securities. Sir, your line is open.
Kevin Cassidy -- Rosenblatt Securities -- Analyst
Thank you. Thanks for taking my question. I'm just -- we're getting a lot of information around input costs going up. And I wonder how you're controlling that.
It looks like even your opex stays kind of flat next quarter, but also just for all your manufacturing. How are you controlling input costs? And what's the outlook for the rest of the year?
Kris Sennesael -- Chief Financial Officer
Yes, Kevin, I mean, this is not a Skyworks specific issue. There's definitely some input cost increases. But as Liam just said, I mean, we control a lot of our own supply chain. And we have -- most of the supply chain is actually in-house.
Now we still do buy some third-party materials, and we have seen some increases there as well. But if you look at the gross margins, I mean, we have been able to slightly improve our gross margins, in part because we do have also a dynamic pricing policy. And that means we increase or decrease prices where we can, depending on our competitive landscape and depending on certain increases or decreases in our cost structure as well.
Kevin Cassidy -- Rosenblatt Securities -- Analyst
OK. Great. And just a reminder on the I&A business that you just acquired, what's the manufacturing strategy with that for the longer term?
Liam Griffin -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yes. I mean right now, we are still operating in kind of the fabless play, although still leveraging our teams in a way that's very cohesive. But there's definitely operational scale advantages with bringing some of the core technologies from the I&A lab business in the core Skyworks facilities. I mean, I think that's -- well, we know, I mean, that's something we're working on right now.
And it is 100% in our control. We don't need help for it. We know exactly what we need to do. We just need to get it done.
And we'll do a lot of things, because it will open up the portfolio greatly. There'll be more scale to drive the products. And there's also, as I said earlier, a great synergy with the technologies that we have today and how they can dovetail with the I&A business, but also the very, very large roster of customers that the slab I&A business has that we can generate and engage our customers today with them. So there's going to be some great synergy there, upside synergy around revenue, and also synergy around operations.
So looking forward to seeing that more as we pursue the business longer.
Operator

Operator
Thank you for standing by. Welcome to ASML 2020 First Quarter Financial Results Conference Call on April 15th, 2020. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to open the question-and-answer queue. [Operator Instructions]
I would now like to turn the conference call over to Mr. Skip Miller. Please go ahead, sir.
Skip Miller -- Vice President of Investor Relations
Thank you, operator. Welcome, everyone. This is Skip Miller, Vice President of Investor Relations at ASML. Joining me today on the call is ASML's CEO, Peter Wennink; and our CFO, Roger Dassen. The subject of today's call is ASML's 2020 first quarter results. The length of this call will be 60 minutes and questions will be taken in the order they are received. This call is also being broadcast live over the Internet at asml.com. The transcript of management's opening remarks and a replay of the call will be available on our website shortly following the conclusion of this call.
Before we begin, I'd like to caution listeners that comments made by management during this conference call will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements involve material risks and uncertainties. For a discussion of risk factors, I encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statement contained in today's press release and presentation found on our website at asml.com and in ASML's report on Form 20-F and other documents that's filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Peter Wennink for a brief introduction.
Peter Wennink -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Skip. Welcome, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our Q1 2020 results conference call. I hope all of you and your families are healthy and safe. And before we start our normal quarterly results review, I would like to first talk about the topic on everybody's mind, which is the COVID-19 pandemic and the situation.
These are unprecedented and challenging times, and the COVID-19 pandemic affects all of us. Our primary goal at ASML continues to be to ensure, as best as we can, that our colleagues and their families stay safe. Our second goal is to ensure that we continue to serve our customers and to secure the delivery of our product roadmap, including the continuity of our supply.
We have been taking, and continue to take, precautionary measures to limit the risks. Most of our non-manufacturing employees now work from home and travel is restricted. In China, our colleagues are returning to the office but also there we remain vigilant.
In our own facilities, we have implemented restricted access to our manufacturing facilities worldwide, and in particular our cleanrooms, to ensure our colleagues can work safely. We put in place measures to help ensure isolation between shifts. We have also implemented additional safety and cleaning protocols to minimize contamination risks. We work closely with our customers, suppliers and partners to share information and determine best practices.
We see a lot of creativity, resilience and dedication at ASML and the industry in overall as we work to manage through this crisis. To date, we have experienced limited impact on ASML's manufacturing capability, although there have been additional challenges with absenteeism, transportation and support logistics that we have had to manage. Some of the quarantine requirements have had an impact on our efficiency, while travel restrictions have posed a challenge for installs and major upgrades. We are working with our customers to plan ahead and find creative solutions such as the use of remote monitoring, augmented reality solutions and diagnostic technologies to aid in the service and repair of systems.
With regard to our supply chain, some of our suppliers have experienced temporary closures resulting from governmental lock down and shelter in place orders. At this stage, we have either been able to work around these temporary disruptions or the closure has been resolved. We are managing risk via alternative sourcing and again a lot of creativity. We are closely monitoring the status and will use safety stock as much as possible to ensure minimum interruption. At this point in time we have been able to find solutions for these challenges.
Regarding customer demand, we have currently not seen a reduction in demand this year and we have seen a strong order intake. I will talk more on this later.
On cash management, although we have a very healthy balance sheet as well as flexibility in our cost structure, we feel it is prudent to preserve cash, should this situation continue for an extended period of time. Not just for our own operation, but also in order to be able to support our suppliers as best we can in these extraordinary circumstances. And Roger will talk more on the detailed actions.
You will all understand that in this environment, it is difficult to determine how things will develop, how long it will last and the impact this will have on the global GDP development that can affect our entire industry.
We are taking the necessary steps in terms of safety, risk mitigation, and financial measures to best manage through these challenging times. It is very encouraging to see the creativity, resilience and dedication at ASML and the industry overall.
Now, I would like to turn our normal quarterly results process. Before we begin the Q&A session, Roger and I would like to provide an overview and some commentary on the first quarter. Roger will start with a review of our Q1 financial performance with added comments on our short-term outlook. And I will complete the introduction with some additional comments on the current business environment and on our future business outlook. Well, thank you. Roger?
Roger Dassen -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, Peter. Welcome, everyone. I hope you are all safe and healthy. I will first review the first quarter financial results and then make some comments on the second quarter of 2020. I will also provide more detail around measures we are taking with regards to cash management.
Net sales came in at EUR2.4 billion, below our original guidance of EUR3.1 billion to EUR3.3 billion, which was primarily related to COVID-19 impact. Net system sales of EUR1.6 billion was again heavily weighted toward Logic at 73%, with the remaining 27% from Memory, clearly showing the continued strength of Logic business. We actually shipped four EUV systems in Q1 but were only able to recognize revenue on two systems, which I will explain in more detail later.
Installed Base Management sales for the quarter came in at EUR857 million. This was around EUR100 million lower than guided due to lack of access to machine time as well as a delay in acceptance of upgrades, we expect these upgrades to translate to revenue in Q2.
Let me provide a bit more detail on the items that occurred in the quarter that resulted in a system revenue shift of around EUR700 million, consisting of a Deep UV related revenue shift over EUR200 million and EUV related revenue shift of over EUR500 million, primarily related to COVID-19 impact.
First, we experienced some delays in Deep UV shipments to customers in Wuhan, China, as well as other customers due to operational and travel restrictions regarding COVID-19. We are working with our customers to prepare for these shipments in the next quarters.
Second, we experienced some issues in our supply chain as a result of a temporary disruption from EUV component suppliers that encountered operational restrictions due to COVID-19 regulations. These supply chain issues have been solved for now. Also, we experienced longer than initially planned EUV cycle times for the first NXE:3400C models in final configuration, primarily driven by the complex deployment of in-line tin refill as part of the modular vessel. Cycle time related to this aspect is now being reduced every week and we are on track to achieving the aspired cycle time reduction envisaged for the end of this year. As you know this is an important element in achieving the capability of 45 to 50 EUV tools in 2021 and beyond. As a result of the longer than expected cycle times, as well as COVID-19 related supply issues, we saw some delays in EUV shipments for the quarter resulting in fewer system shipments than originally planned.
Third, due to concerns around the continued ability to ship systems in the current circumstances, some customers have asked us to expedite the delivery of EUV systems in the quarter by shipping the systems before the normal Factory Acceptance Tests. The implication of this is a delay in our revenue recognition as final acceptance will now take place after successful installation at the customer site.
We expect the revenue that we were not able to recognize for Q1 as a result of the issues listed above to shift to Q2 and Q3 of this year. Gross margin for the quarter was 45.1%, also below our original guidance primarily due to a combination of delayed field upgrades as well as delayed Deep UV systems revenue, related to COVID-19 impact. Overall operating expenses came within guidance, with R&D expenses at EUR544 million and SG&A expenses at EUR130 million.
Turning to the balance sheet, EUR507 million worth of shares were repurchased in Q1. We ended last quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at a level of EUR4.1 billion.
Moving to the order book, Q1 system bookings came in at a strong EUR3.1 billion, including EUR1.5 billion from eleven EUV systems. Logic order intake was 66% of the total value with the remaining 34% from Memory, again reflecting the continued strong Logic demand for leading edge lithography for this year and next year, but also indicating a recovery of the demand for Memory. Net income in Q1 was EUR391 million, representing 16% of net sales and resulting in an EPS of EUR0.93.
With that I would like to make some comments on Q2 of 2020. As Peter mentioned, we have not seen a reduction in demand this year and we continue to see a strong order intake, up around 28% from Q4. Based on current plans, without any COVID interruption, Q2 can be a strong shipment quarter with revenue up potentially over 50% from Q1, and a significant improvement of gross margin. We are still planning to execute to current plan. However, due to significant uncertainty in this COVID-19 environment, we decided it is prudent to refrain from giving formal guidance for Q2.
Finally, on cash management, although we have a very healthy balance sheet as well as flexibility in our cost structure, we, like many of our peers and customers, are dependent on the short and longer-term implications of the COVID-19 outbreak. Due to these uncertainties, we feel it is prudent to preserve cash should this situation continue for an extended period of time. Not just for our own operations, but also in order to be able to support our suppliers as best we can in these extraordinary circumstances.
We have decided not to execute any share buybacks in Q2 2020. This decision follows the pause in the execution of the program in the first quarter, after having already performed share buybacks under the new program for an amount of approximately EUR507 million. The previously announced three-year share buyback program of up to EUR6.0 billion to be executed 2020-2022, is still in place.
We have also implemented measures to limit our growth in the workforce. Non-business critical vacancies have been put on hold. We continue to hire for business-critical positions. This way, our workforce will grow less than originally planned this year. We are also postponing any non-business critical opex and capex. However, we will continue to invest in the development of future technology roadmaps, including High-NA, at an unadjusted pace, in order to allow our customers the continuation of their roadmaps once the situation has been normalized.
As communicated last quarter, ASML has submitted a proposal at the 2020 Annual General Meeting of shareholders to declare a total dividend for 2019 of EUR2.40 per ordinary share. Recognizing the interim dividend of EUR1.05 paid in November 2019, this leads to a final dividend payment of EUR1.35 to be paid in the second quarter. This is a 14% increase compared to the 2018 dividend. The 2020 Annual General Meeting of shareholders, will take place on April 22 in Veldhoven.
With that I'd like to turn the call back over to Peter.
Peter Wennink -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Roger. As Roger highlighted, our order intake is strong and we have not yet seen any significant push-outs or cancellations this year. Many investments of our customers are strategic and support their technology roadmaps, a lifeline for our leading-edge customers. These strategic investments are therefore primarily related to leading edge equipment, such as EUV and high-end Immersion scanners, requiring longer lead times and qualification schedules. This was also confirmed recently by leading-edge customers that have also told us that they see an unabated demand for leading-edge devices, at least throughout this year. Keep in mind, the lead time and qualification of lithography systems are the longest in the fab and customers will not want to jeopardize any adjustments to their technology and capacity ramps that will negatively affect their ability to keep serving their leading-edge customers.
As the current situation is very fluid, we are meeting with our customers on a more frequent basis to understand any changes they may be seeing regarding demand outlook. In general most customers are still indicating that they are continuing relatively normal fab operations so far. Logic customers are currently continuing to ramp their 7 nanometer and 5 nanometer node in support of end market applications like 5G, AI and high-performance compute. There are also some positive signs being reported on data center demand as well as demand for notebook and communication infrastructure driven by the significant increase in work from home and virtual learning activities. These applications drive the demand for both Logic and Memory. However, it can also be expected that consumer related electronics demand, for example, smartphones may be under stress, in addition to the potential negative impact the COVID-19 crisis will have on GDP.
We expect Installed Base business to continue to scale with growing installed base numbers and we will also see EUV contribute to service revenue as these systems start running wafers in volume manufacturing. We currently have plans for upgrades at several customers however with the realization there is a supply and demand risk in the current environment.
Our bookings show an increase in Memory over the prior quarter driven by Deep UV, while Logic continues to show a transition from Deep UV to EUV ordering as customer confidence in EUV increases, translating into more layers in Logic production.
On EUV, along with the industry, ASML continues to make progress in ramping EUV technology in high volume manufacturing, as was recently showcased at the SPIE lithography conference in February. Our customers continue to adopt and ramp EUV in high volume manufacturing in both Logic and Memory. And one of our Memory customers recently announced that they have successfully shipped 1 million of the industry's first 10 nanometer class DRAM modules based on EUV technology. They also stated EUV will be fully deployed in future generations of DRAM, starting with its fourth-generation 10 nanometer D1a next year.
We continue to target EUV revenue of around EUR4.5 billion from 35 systems this year, thereby assuming that we will not face any significant supply/demand risks as mentioned before. On margins for EUV, we continue to drive profitability in both the systems as well as the service business. We are still on track to achieve at least 40% system gross margin this year and break even with our EUV service business by the end of year.
Increased customer confidence in EUV technology is translating to strong EUV demand in both Logic and Memory. This is reflected in the strong order flow in the first quarter in support of our 2021 output. As mentioned in earlier calls, we are currently working toward a capacity of 45 to 50 systems in 2021, which we feel can be achieved through reductions in cycle time. We continue to make progress on our next generation EUV technology, High-NA, and are on track to ship the initial development systems in 2022.
Now, regarding our outlook on the quarter and on the year. Based on current customer demand plans and without any COVID interruption, Q2 can be a strong shipment quarter, with significant improvement of gross margin, as Roger mentioned. We are currently in execution of this plan.
On the full year, customer demand is currently strong as well and the current shipment plans would position us well for another year of growth. However, there is a significant uncertainty about how the current COVID-19 crisis will impact the global GDP development, end markets, our manufacturing capability and supply chain. In light of these risks and uncertainties we decided it is prudent to refrain from giving formal guidance for Q2 and for the full year 2020.
Again, these are unprecedented and challenging times, but we will get through it. The world looks a lot different today than it did three months ago. So it is hard to make predictions and we are certainly not adding opinions. We continue to look at the facts, day by day and act accordingly. We are taking the necessary steps for the safety of our employees, the community and our customers, as well as the necessary risk mitigation and financial steps.
I would like also to take the opportunity to thank the entire ASML team and their families, as well as our many partners, who have stepped up in these demanding times in support of our Company and our stakeholders. I have seen great examples of teamwork and incredible creativity to make sure that we can continue our work, serving our customers while keeping our people and partners safe.
Despite the fact that the current environment provides clearly near-term challenges and uncertainties, the positive industry momentum around innovation and expanding new markets further strengthens our confidence in our future growth scenarios.
With that we would be happy to take your questions.
Skip Miller -- Vice President of Investor Relations
Thank you, Peter and Roger. The operator will instruct you momentarily on the protocol for the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions]
Operator, could we have your final instructions and then the first question please?
Questions and Answers:
Operator
Thank you. At this time, we will begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Mr. Sandeep Deshpande. Please state your company name, followed by your question.
Sandeep Deshpande -- JP Morgan -- Analyst
Yeah. Hi. Sandeep Deshpande, JP Morgan. Thanks for having me on the call. My first question to you Peter is that you've seen very great order strength in the first quarter. Is this order strength essentially what -- if you remember, in January you've said that you were hoping the Memory orders would come in through the year. It was these Memory orders coming in, which caused this order strength or was it something else like customers were worried that they could -- you've been -- they may not get tools from you and so they expedited their orders to -- and brought them forward from later in the year, which is what caused this order strength?
And my second question which is a follow -- not a follow-up, but with regard to your 40% gross margin indications in EUV for the year is, I mean, given the social distancing, etc. associated with -- which you may be implementing even in manufacturing, will that not have an impact on the cycle times and thus the gross margin? Thank you.
Peter Wennink -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Okay. Let me answer this first question. I think the order strength, and I think Roger said it, about two-thirds of the order intake was Logic and one-third was Memory. So I don't think it is an acceleration of it. It is something that we would -- that we expected, also driven by, I think what we observe as a continued increase in utilization in the memory space of our machines. So that actually fits in quite nicely.
I don't think they were pull-ins either. These orders are there to support our outlook for 2021. And this was planned. So basically you could say it's more a confirmation of the technology roadmap that our customers have in front of them. So in that sense good. Only gross margin indication of 40%. The cycle time impact, we've been able to manage. I mentioned it, we did see an increase in absenteeism in the factories, because of the guidelines that people followed by the government, the health authorities, basically saying, if you have symptoms like some of the COVID-19 symptoms, you should stay at home, which people did, even when they had a cold, which actually meant that we did have indeed some shortages in the factory. But we've been able to reorder shift patterns and also what we're seeing is that people that are eligible to work in the factory, for instance from R&D environment, they are now also working in the factory to make sure that we can do the output. So I think we can manage, and I don't think it will have an impact on the 40% gross margin indication that we gave you.

The next question is from Mr. David Mulholland. Please state your company name, followed by your question.
David Mulholland -- UBS -- Analyst
Hi, it's David from UBS. Just following up on one of the comments that Roger made in terms of how you're looking to I guess in some respects support your supplier base. Can you just give us a little bit more detail about what you're considering there? And are there any particular suppliers that you might be worried about where a particular other part of their business might be, I guess, heavily or it was exposed that we've seen a very sudden downturn just a little bit more color on how you're planning to support your supplier base.
Peter Wennink -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, let me answer that. I think, we are managing our supplier base almost on a day-to-day basis. And most of what we see in the supply chain currently are delays in delivery of modules and as a result of those, let's say, lock down situations or shelter in place situation where we need to find different solutions, leading to a delay of parts. However, as you pointed out, when this situation last longer, we also could see that some of our suppliers that are also exposed to other industries that currently are not in the, perhaps some of our enviable position where we are, there might be -- they are looking for help from our side. And that help would largely be requests for prepayments.
Now, we don't see that yet, but I would expect if this last longer that it would come and they want some prepayments on orders when our demand profile stays as strong as it is. Having said that, you have to look at the -- at our integral supply chain, which includes our customers. I mean, what is true for our supplier is also true for us. So we are of course also in discussion with our customers to say, listen, we need to look at the continuity of the supply chain from an integral point of view. So if we need to prepay suppliers, I need prepayments from our customers. So it is almost, you could say, it's a back-to-back link in terms of potential financing requests.
I'm pretty sure that some of them will come, yeah, and especially in those areas where, as you pointed out some of our suppliers are losing significant business in other industries. So this is what we are -- we don't see it yet, but I mean it's been around long enough and also in some other crisis, going back to the -- to the internet bubble burst and then the financial crisis and 9/11 that will in their supply chain, some potential issues will pop up, that will just happen. But again, we need to look at this from an integral point of view, from an integral supply chain point of view and our customers play a significant role there also, which by the way, we are in discussion with them and I think these are good discussions. So I'm pretty positive that we can help those areas in our supply chain, which could become critical going forward.
David Mulholland -- UBS -- Analyst
Great. Thanks. And just one follow-up on the R&D side of the business was you said, as many as can are working from home. I presume you haven't closed down R&D facilities, because I guess a lot of the work you do still needs to be, I guess, physical test, particularly in the case of High-NA and work is going on there.
Peter Wennink -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I think, if you really talk about the physical tests, I mean, that is done in cleanrooms and we build modules. So that's an agreement [Phonetic] and we talked about this. I mean, we have very strict regulations there now almost for, I would say, almost for two months. And they are effective on the R&D side itself. It is -- when we look at the latest productivity numbers, which we follow on a day-to-day basis, I think 90% of our R&D engineers they work from home. But with the current possibilities that we have in creating virtual teams they are working off-site, I can say that I'm pleasantly surprised with the productivity numbers that I see, whether it's the number of design sign-offs, whether it's the number of software builds, the software calculations, our IT infrastructure is holding up very well, which we prepared by the way. So that's going well. And when we look at those productivity numbers, they actually are very similar to the productivity numbers that we saw before starting to work at home, which I think is very good, which is also a tribute to the flexibility of our people.
You see also in the log-on numbers that people make much longer hours. I mean, they log-on the same time, but they log-off much later. So there's a lot of working in the evening. And we check very regularly with our managers across the Company of how we are doing and there's a lot of virtual teamwork going on even leading to virtual drinks in Friday afternoon, where they all sit together in front of the camera with a glass of beer.
David Mulholland -- UBS -- Analyst
Yeah. Thanks, guys.

Your next question is from Mr. Joe Quatrochi. Please state your company name, followed by your question.
Joe Quatrochi -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst
Yeah. Thanks. It's Wells Fargo. I was hoping you could kind of give us some more color on the strong Memory bookings that you reported. Can you help us understand, are you starting to see demand largely driven by NAND or DRAM and then to the extent that you can help us understand what was EUV in terms of the Memory bookings, was that also a driver this quarter?
Peter Wennink -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, EUV, the last question is, it's really Logic. So we have very few EUV orders, that will come. Sorry, very few EUV orders for Memory, and that will come. So it is predominantly Logic. And the strong Memory bookings are -- and I actually said it earlier, they are also the result of what, at least, we are seeing in terms of utilization of our systems in the memory space both in DRAM and in NAND, the trend we -- the cautious trend that we saw at the end of Q4 of last year has continued in terms of increased utilization throughout Q1 until very recently, until last week. So the trends are upwards, so that explains why Memory bookings are going up also, because customer see this also.
Joe Quatrochi -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst
Thanks. That's helpful. And then, you talked a lot about what ASML is doing in terms of services to meet your customers need. Is there any kind of updated thoughts you can give us on, I think, you talked about EUR3.4 billion for revenue for 2020 for services. And should we think about like the first quarter or March quarter being kind of the low point for services this year?
Roger Dassen -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. I think, we mentioned why Q1 was about EUR100 million below our guidance and we gave you the reason for that. It is the lack of machine time that we had on particular upgrades that we were doing and as a result of that will fall into Q2. Other than that in the installed base business still looks good. So the number that we talked about in the past is a number that has still relevance with all the caveats that we talk about in the entire call around the current uncertainty.
Joe Quatrochi -- Wells Fargo -- Analyst
Thank you.
Roger Dassen -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Indeed a EUR3.4 billion is the number that we talked about on the Q4 call. So that's a good recollection of what we mentioned there.
Operator
The next question is from Mr. C.J. Muse. Please state your company name followed by your question.
C.J. Muse -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst
Yeah, Evercore ISI. Good afternoon, good morning. Thank you for taking the question. I guess, Peter, first question just to follow up on the Memory side of things, it looks like ex EUV your orders were up like 80% Q-on-Q. And so curious on that front, is that more NAND versus DRAM? And then, on the last call you talked about optionality to stronger DRAM recovery into the second half of the year. I'm curious what your thoughts are as it relates to that potential reality.
Peter Wennink -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I think, when I answer you have to take into consideration that customers for instance do do relocations. So we might be shipping to a DRAM fab, a leading-edge machine that is replacing a machine that was on a pedestal that now goes to NAND. So there is some relocation there, but I would say that the Memory intake is driven by DRAM. And then with the caveat that we do also see some relocation out of DRAM into the NAND. But I would say if you would have to answer and say, where does the -- what's the emphasis, the emphasis is on DRAM.
C.J. Muse -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst
Okay. Great. Very helpful. My follow-up, can you speak directly to how you're thinking about cycle time improvements on EUV? And as part of that, what will it take to get the ability for you to have double-digit shipments on a quarterly basis, which it looks like you need to do to hit that 35 unit forecast. And I guess, as part of that, should we be thinking about the potential for customers to expedite again in the coming quarters and therefore perhaps maybe revenue on one or two tools gets delayed into '21? Thank you.
Peter Wennink -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Well, on the last point, I mean it's April 15. So I don't know what's going to happen in the December. So that's not what our customers tell us today. Our customers tell us today that they want the 35 systems. On the cycle time improvement and our ability to ship double-digit numbers, we are planning. And without any supply chain or capacity disruptions because of COVID, we will ship double-digit numbers in this quarter in Q2 of 2020. So we have that capability.
And when you look at this and let's say customers have a number of 36 units that they want, it's not nine, nine, nine, nine every quarter. It is not how it works and it works when the customers need it, because it's their ramp schedule that is going to determine when we ship. For instance, in Q1, we only shipped four systems, but what we planned before the COVID-19 impact, six in Q1. Not that we couldn't make more, it just -- it also has to do with when the customers need the machines. So we will do double-digit in this quarter and actually means that we have the capability, which is of course very important to get to the 35 numbers. I think the cycle time reductions, and it was one earlier comment, we have some absenteeism in the factory we are dealing with that. I think we will get to the cycle time reductions as planned and we will have the capability to do 35 system this year.

Your next question is from Mr. Krish Sankar. Please state your company name followed by your question.
Krish Sankar -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst
Yeah. Hi. It's Krish from Cowen. Thanks for taking my question. I have two of them. First one, Peter, to the extent you can answer this, what do you think you would ship in terms of DUV units this year in absolute unit numbers or relative to 2019?
Peter Wennink -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Relative to 2019, you will see -- that's just a general comment. I'm not going to guide you on a specific Deep UV number, but as we said before and have said for some time now that when you look at EUV, EUV is cannibalizing you could say some multiple patterning layers. So there will be a reduction of Deep UV systems in 2020 and that will be more than compensated by the sales number in EUV, and that's logical, that's what we've always said, you know, EUV is there to cannibalize multiple patterning layers.
Now, how much of that in the end will be, is going to be somewhat now lower, it's not going to be significant, but that is the trend. It's a trend going forward. As you can also see from our 2025 Capital Markets Day information where you also see that in 2025, the Deep UV numbers are lower than what they used to be. And that's because EUV is going to replace those.
Krish Sankar -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst
Got it, got it. That's helpful, Peter. And then, as my follow-up, if I look at your -- for the last two quarters, if I look at your Memory shipments and compare, it is very similar to the sales into China. So A, is most of your Memory shipment in the last two quarters coming mainly from China? And B, how do you expect that to trend over the next couple of quarters?
Peter Wennink -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Well, it's -- as you know and I said, we actually mentioned that, the shipments in Q1 were impacted by the COVID-19 price in China, especially Wuhan, where there's a Memory customer there, yeah. Well, you can imagine, we didn't ship anything to that customer. The other customer took a few tools according to plan. But the majority, of course, of everything that we ship was outside China.
Krish Sankar -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst

Your next question comes from Mr. Pierre Ferragu. Please state your company name, followed by your question.
Pierre Ferragu -- New Street Research -- Analyst
Hi, thank you for taking my question. It's Pierre at New Street. So Peter and Roger, from your prepared remarks, I understand like the near term of COVID-19 played out clearly not so bad for you and your value chain and that you're managing very well logistics disruption and all like the supply side of the story. Now, of course, my next concern is, what happens next. And I hear you that we have very little visibility. So it's very -- it's impossible to make like a near-term forecast. But my question would be like a what-if question. So let's assume that in the second half of the year, given for PC, servers and smartphones are down 20%, 25% year-on-year, if that happens at a high level, how do you see your clients impacted and how do you see that's impacting ASML?
And I had two specific like question marks in mind. One is, in that kind of scenario would your clients push out EUV orders or do you think they need to take orders anyway, because they need to secure supply of the technology. And then the second one I had in mind was, what about of a very steep decline risk in DUV, because I imagine that if volumes are not where they where expected when rollout plans were made six months ago, I would expect a lot of free use of the EUV tools as node migrations continue.
Peter Wennink -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Let me first answer your question, how does it impact ASML on a certain scenario. Basically, I couldn't answer that. I mean, I could be a bit mean and say that's your work, not mine, yeah. But, so...
Pierre Ferragu -- New Street Research -- Analyst
Point taken. Point taken.
Peter Wennink -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yes. So, but what I would answer is that if you don't know where you're going, you better be flexible, yeah. And this is what we are organizing. We're organizing for flexibility in the supply chain. As you know, 80% or 80% plus is in the supply chain. That means that we very like with every crisis we hardly ever saw cancellations we saw push-outs. So it basically means you would be looking at, in the supply chain, financing of working capital, which is also particularly important in the context of the answer I gave to a question earlier, what do you want to do in the supply chain, which I think is an integral supply chain problem, which includes our customers. I mean, they cannot do without supply in the end, either. So it's working capital issue, which I think is manageable. I think from a flexibility point of view, we have a lot of cost flexibility here with our variable cost on labor, that was a lot of variable cost, like variable income to our people, which of course when the business goes down, that will go down also.
I don't think there will be a lot of push-outs for EUV orders. What our customers are telling us now when I listen well to them, they are not blind, they see that the impact on GDP will be recessionary. And that will very likely have an impact on consumer spending and on the consumer electronics. What they do notice is that the customers, our customers are not blind either, that the demand on the leading-edge Logic, which includes 5 nanometer and 7 nanometer is still strong. I mean, our customers tell us every time, every week that we talk to them, please stay on target with your shipments of your leading-edge machines.
Now, if data centers would require 25% less a service, which by the way, if you think about, it is probably that it's -- and then something very bad has actually happened, because we need more data center capacity and not less. And then, that's where the high compute goes. So I think push-out of EUV orders, it can always happen. I don't think it's going to be significant. We are not planning for an armageddon scenario where the entire world economy crumbles into an abyss, we're not planning that. I don't think it's going to happen either. I think it's a low likelihood. So all in all, I think we are flexible enough, I think EUV, with the -- with key focus on leading-edge solutions that our customers need is going to be relatively safe.
And I think reuse of Deep UV tools, the story of reuse of Deep UV tools has always been very prominent in every cycle. But you need to realize that when you look at leading-edge, it's not only EUV, it's leading-edge Deep UV, but you need Deep UV not so much for the geometrical shrink, you need it for overlay. Yeah. And that is very important for those new leading-edge devices. So the overlay requirements for an NXE 2050, which will be our leading-edge immersion tool is significantly different than an 1980, because the 1980 will not be able to do what the 2050 should be doing to make sure that they can support our leading-edge nodes. So reuse will be limited, simply has to do with the fact that the requirements that are needed for leading-edge nodes for Deep UV tools are different and they are also more difficult for the older generations to achieve.
Pierre Ferragu -- New Street Research -- Analyst
Great. Thanks a lot. So we have our homework to do, but you give us a lot of hint. Thanks for that.
Peter Wennink -- President and Chief Executive Officer

The next question is from Mr. Mehdi Hosseini. Please state your company name followed by your question.
Mehdi Hosseini -- Susquehanna -- Analyst
Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Peter, going back to the topic of where we're going to, I'm still confused. You talked about the improvement in the supply chain, you talked about sequential revenue growth that could exceed 50%, but you are not providing the guide, not even for Q2. What is it out there -- we are halfway through April, what is it out there that makes you uncomfortable given what you see in the next two months. I'm not asking for the second half. I'm asking about just the Q2 and I have a follow-up.
Peter Wennink -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, no, I fully understand your question, Mehdi, because we always say where we have very long lead times in the supply chain, which is true for the critical suppliers like, for instance, ZEISS. We have, in the end, if you take tier 2 also, thousands of suppliers with some of them have lead times which are a lot shorter. We've had the delays in EUV in Q1 of a couple of weeks, because one particular supplier couldn't provide rings, floor rings, which is not a most advanced part that we need, but if you don't have it, you don't have it. So this is where our concern comes from.
It's the tiered supply chain, which is not always that visible to us. We have tiered suppliers coming from Malaysia [Technical Issues] Mexico, you name it, and they are supplying to our tier 2 and tier 1 suppliers. And if that supply basically stops, then even a part that has a relatively short lead time doesn't arrive on time, we get a delay. I think ultimately we get those parts, it's just a delay. And if we tell you -- we give you a number, yeah, and we get a significant delay in some of those short lead time parts, we cannot ship tools and that can be significant. You may remember that a 3400C now is on a EUR30 million tool, that's a big number. And I don't want to give you a range from x billion to y billion, it doesn't make sense.
So this is where it comes from. And I think it is really based on the experience that we've had, in Q1, we were able to manage it, but we did see some delays and it seems we cannot judge what the impact will be of these governmental orders in different parts of the world, we cannot assess what that risk is, but it's there, because we've seen it. We've been able to manage it with a lot of creativity, it doesn't give me any assurance or certainty that we will be able to manage it going forward always. So this is where it comes from.
Mehdi Hosseini -- Susquehanna -- Analyst
Very clear. Thank you. And if you could, give us an update on Hermes multi-beam shipment. I think, the beta tool was supposed to be shipped to the customer in Q1. And what's the update there?
Peter Wennink -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, I think it was good [Phonetic], it was ready. It was in packing, and then the shelter in place in the Bay Area, because that's where it comes from, it comes from San Jose just stopped the tool. So it was -- that the trucks were pulling up and they had to return.
Mehdi Hosseini -- Susquehanna -- Analyst
Well, do you see the trucks are going to resume their destination in Q2 or is it going to be [Speech Overlap].
Peter Wennink -- President and Chief Executive Officer
No, I think, listen, I mean, what we are doing now, we are assessing whether we and this particular tool falls under the definition of a critical business and actually we are looking into what the possibilities are to actually ship the tool. And I would love to ship the tool ASAP, because it's ready and the customer wants it. So, let's see how things go.
Mehdi Hosseini -- Susquehanna -- Analyst

Your next question is from Mr. Mitch Steves. Please state your company name, followed by your question.
Mitch Steves -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst
Yeah. This is Mitch Steves from RBC. I just had a question on the services business. I'm trying to understand a little bit better. So I'm guessing you guys were able to do some of this remotely. Could you maybe walk us through how much revenue you guys think will come back, how much revenue you may have lost in Q1 and then how it would work if like we get out of the shelter in place, say earlier? Would that be a lot of pent-up demand, where you see a snap up or does the services business kind of actually just get hit and some of the revenues are lost?
Roger Dassen -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
I think, the revenue, Mitch, that we lost in Q1, as we mentioned, is around EUR100 million and it's primarily related to certain upgrades. I would say, it's not even related to COVID-19 in particular, it was related to the fact that we didn't get sufficient machine time from customers, so that revenue we missed for Q1, we'll get it in Q2. There's hardly any doubt in my mind, we will get that in Q2.
And other than that, I don't think there is going -- as far as we can see right now, we don't see any anomalies. So at this stage, still on track for the EUR3.4 billion in IBM revenue that we talked about in the previous quarter. As we also mentioned in the video and as Peter talked about in the introduction, we are deploying new technologies, right, so of course, we're less able than we were in the past to have people go from Veldhoven from Wilton, etc., and go to the customer locations for obvious reasons for the travel restriction and what have you. But by using artificial -- by using virtual reality, augmented reality type technology, we are able to support the huge local support teams that we have with very specialized knowledge that we have at the different hubs. And in that way so far we think we're still well-positioned to keep up providing the service and the upgrade work that we need to do.
Peter Wennink -- President and Chief Executive Officer
One additional comment here, it's more anecdotal. That's actually we were preparing as a kind of a prototype project somewhere deep in the organization, how can we support remotely through augmented reality and hollow lenses, basically people sitting 6,000 kilometers from the actual service action. And then we have now over the shoulder 3D augmented reality support that service engineers with six months of training that would normally have to do this after two to three year training were now operating and doing service actions with the support of experts that were sitting 6,000 kilometers away and basically providing them with 3D images, how they should do the service actions and it works. So this is also something that amazed us also. And actually our service levels, we keep up all our service levels up in terms of maintenance and servicing of our tools, which I think is a really good achievement.
Operator
Your next question is from Mr. Achal Sultania. Please state your company name, followed by your question.
Achal Sultania -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst
Hi. Good morning. It's Credit Suisse. Yeah, Peter, maybe one question from my side. On the services, you mentioned that so far you've tried to do a lot of remote working and local team assisting to get maintenance and upgrades done. How should we think about the EUV installation part? Do you have teams in place, if customer fabs are at customer locations to make sure that EUV installation can still go ahead as per plan at least during Q2...
Peter Wennink -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, it's a very...
Achal Sultania -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst
If current restrictions are not lifted?
Peter Wennink -- President and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, that's a very good question. Luckily, we have three main sites where we do EUV and that's also the sites where we have most of our service engineers. I mean, we have to think of 1,000 plus. So there is a lot of experience there and this is exactly where this remote support comes in. We do send people across the globe, but that's where we have hundreds of people, hundreds of people traveling, it's now probably not more than 50, 60. They have to go into two weeks of quarantine, they have to get a special travel visa. So we need to plan and prepare this much more rigorously than we did in the past. And this is where we do send experts.
But I think, lot of these service actions that are not of the really top notch expert level are being trained and being done with the kind of novel remote support technologies that I just mentioned. So it's a combination of both. And I think we'll be able to do all the installations. We have been able to actually do that and we are. So yes, we still do travel, it's not going back to zero, but it's a fraction of what we were able to do.
Achal Sultania -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst
Thanks, Peter. And maybe one follow-up for Roger. Roger, on the services side, you mentioned EUR3.4 billion is still in sight for the full year. Can you help us understand like how much of that -- within that will be EUV specifically and also how much of losses for EUV services can we expect? I know you mentioned breakeven hopefully by the end of the year. Because, the thing that I'm trying to understand is how much of a drag on services gross margin has EUV been last year or maybe this year just to help us get to what the number should be going forward?
Roger Dassen -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, let me be very short on that. So, for this year, I think quarter-over-quarter what -- so if you compared the last quarter, so Q4 to today, that would probably account for 0.5% in gross margin. So the improvement in EUV this year is going to account for about 0.5% in gross margin for the year. So that's an answer to that question.
In general, if you look at the EUR3.4 billion, it's about 50-50 in terms of regular serve as a maintenance, if you like, and upgrades, and the regular service and maintenance EUV is still a fairly small number given of course, the installed base for Deep UV is so much larger. But the impact on the gross margin percentage, about 0.5%.
Achal Sultania -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst
Okay. Thank you, Roger.

Andrew Gardiner -- Barclays -- Analyst
Hi, it's Andrew from Barclays. Thanks for squeezing me in here at the end. Just a follow-up really on the comments you guys have been making on the Memory tool utilization. Peter, you said you've seen it improve sort of from late fourth quarter into first quarter and just out this quarter. I'm just wondering how much flex do you think the industry still has to continue to grow bit output by raising utilization, when are they going to get close to full utilization, again based on the current trends. Obviously, I know we've got the global caveats, but just this, if trends were to continue, how close are we to that full utilization where they need to start adding capacity again?
Peter Wennink -- President and Chief Executive Officer
I think, that will be this quarter. When I look at the trend it's going to be, it's pretty close. They still have a bit of -- and the utilization to go, but it will be this quarter.

",9332,"ASML's 2020 first-quarter earnings call, held on April 15, 2020, discussed the company's financial performance amid the COVID-19 pandemic. CEO Peter Wennink and CFO Roger Dassen highlighted how the crisis has impacted operations and provided an overview of the quarterly financial results.

Peter Wennink noted that despite the unprecedented times, ASML's primary concern was ensuring the health and safety of its workforce, while also maintaining its commitment to delivering products and adhering to their roadmap. The company has implemented various safety measures across its facilities, including restricted access and enhanced cleaning protocols. Despite facing challenges such as increased absenteeism and transportation issues, operational impacts on manufacturing have been minimal. Initiatives such as remote monitoring and augmented reality tools have been used to overcome installation and maintenance hurdles.

Concerning the supply chain, some disruptions were reported due to governmental lockdowns, but alternative sourcing strategies and utilization of safety stocks have helped mitigate major impacts. ASML also continues to observe strong customer demand with robust order intakes, indicating no reduction in demand within the year.

Roger Dassen reviewed the financial details, noting that net sales for the quarter were €2.4 billion, down from the projected €3.1 to €3.3 billion, largely due to the pandemic. System sales were primarily driven by the logic sector, which stood at 73%, while memory contributed the remaining 27%. The gross margin for the quarter was reported at 45.1%, slightly under the anticipated due to delays influenced by COVID-19.

Despite the current uncertainties, ASML has a strong balance sheet but has opted to preserve cash amid potential ongoing impacts from the crisis. This includes supporting suppliers crucial to its operations and pausing share buybacks in Q2. Additionally, the company continues to invest significantly in R&D, especially in developing EUV technology, with a steady progress towards the planned release of next-generation systems.

For the year ahead, they withheld formal guidance due to the unpredictable nature of the global situation but are preparing for a strong shipment quarter in Q2, provided there are no further disruptions. The call concluded with Peter reaffirming ASML's dedicated response to the ongoing challenges and reiterating confidence in their strategic direction despite current uncertainties.",359,"ASML's 2020 first-quarter earnings call, held April 15, 2020, discussed company's financial performance amid COVID-19 pandemic.
